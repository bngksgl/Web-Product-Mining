# Web-Product-Mining

E-commerce can be defined as ’the activity of buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet’. Web, in a way changed our shopping behavior and became the root for emerging online business or shopping web sites. Amazon was one of the first ecommerce web sites initially launched in 1995 for selling books and now has become the largest online retailer in the world offering more than 500 million products worldwide (Spacehero, 2018). By just looking at the number of products available on amazon, one can imagine the amount of products that is available in the web. This vast amount of information regarding products can be used to determine how product features influence product prices or how specific features of products influence the perception in customer reviews. The process of extracting knowledge from web using data mining techniques known as web mining, involves multiple steps; web crawling, product feature extraction, schema matching, multi-level classification, identity resolution and sentiment analysis. In this project I have focused on two aspects; hieararchical product classification and identity resolution.
