&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The EOS 750D features a truly superb 24.2 megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6 processor. This delivers detailed, low-noise digital photographs which are ideal for printing.&lt;/p&gt;
Better still, with fast shutter speeds you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to capture great moments even in low light conditions. This is thanks to an ISO range which is expandable to 100-12800. And with a high responsive autofocus system that features 19 cross-type AF points which can be selected individually, in small groups or as a active area depending on your subject, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to focus in on your subject with precision and speed.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&amp;rdquo; vari-angle screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Assisting with creative shooting is the fully articulating screen. Perfect for capturing &amp;lsquo;selfies&amp;rsquo;, low or high shots, the vari-angle touchscreen can provide your images with a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

Super-fast shooting combines with stunning image quality to let you capture every moment, whether it be wildlife in action or amazing close-ups. Incredibly fast autofocus keeps track of the subject, no matter how speedy, while 20 frames-per-second burst shooting and the 6K Photo feature let you select the perfect high quality still. High Resolution mode captures 80 megapixel equivalent shots for brilliantly-detailed macro work, while easy Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi connection lets you share your work quickly and wirelessly. With an exceptionally clear OLED viewfinder and free angle touch screen, it&#x27;s built for rugged use out in the field with a splashproof, dust proof and freeze-proof body. All this tech unites to make the G9 the supreme outdoor and wildlife camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Image Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its 20.3-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor without low-pass filter captures a superb level of detail, colour and brightness. The Venus Engine processor renders high-precision yet natural images with Multipixel Luminance Generation and Intelligent Detail Processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stunningly Fast Shooting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Super-fast, high precision DFD (depth from defocus) autofocus achieves staggeringly fast AF speed of just 0.04 seconds, so the G9 locks on and never loses the target. And with burst shooting at 20fps with continuous AF, you&#x27;ll capture amazing shots of even the most fast-moving subjects. With a compatible lens, Dual image stabilisation, a combination of Body and Optical stabilisation, compensates for camera shake and blur, up to 6.5 stops. It&#x27;s ideal for optimising telephoto, night-time, and one-handed shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K Movie, 6K Photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Shoot the moving image in hyper-detailed 4K UHD. An amazing level of detail is captured in beautifully smooth motion at up to 60p.  With the brilliant 6K Photo mode, shoot continuously at 30 frames per second and then select the perfect still as an up to 18MP jpeg. It&#x27;s a superb way to get that spot-on split second composition when shooting very fast-moving nature, sports or action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Resolution Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For stunning landscape and close-up macro photography, High Resolution mode delivers 80 megapixel equivalent images in JPEG &amp; RAW format. An incredible level of detail and depth is captured by combining 8 images taken while shifting the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi makes wireless connection with your smart device easy, for instant sharing of your work. A Bluetooth low energy connection maintains a consistent and reliable link with your smart phone or tablet, while using minimal power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough, Resilient Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ideal for shots of the natural world out in the wild, the G9 is built for the outdoor life. Its magnesium alloy body is splash-proof, dust-proof, and freeze-proof down to -10°C. A fully free angle touch screen lets you get the shot no matter how difficult the angle, and provides intuitive touch control. An OLED viewfinder offers an exceptionally clear view with 100% coverage, high magnification ratio of 0.83x (35mm equivalent) and 10,000:1 contrast ratio for supreme visibility.  It also features a double SD card slot supporting high speed UHS-II compatibility. With a smaller and lighter body than a DSLR it&#x27;s ideal for travelling light while not sacrificing image quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lumix Lens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This kit is supplied with the LUMIX G VARIO 12-60mm F3.5-5.6 ASPH. POWER O.I.S. lens.  A versatile lens with a focal range from wide angle 12mm to telephoto 60mm, it excels at crystal clear macro shots too, and is tough enough to withstand heavy field use.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the biggest advantages of this camera is the sheer shooting flexibility on offer. You can use additional lenses to take wide-angle, telephoto, or close-up shots to suit just about any situation.

A leap forward in autofocus tech to ultra-fast levels combines with an enormous 25x optical zoom range for amazing precision versatility. With legendary optics and powerful image processing, you can shoot extraordinary high resolution photos and 4K movies. Zoom in from afar, shoot in extreme close-up, or capture super slo-mo footage. Triple ring manual control and touch screen focussing make manual operation smooth, intuitive and accurate.  The RX10 IV gives you DSLR-quality results, without the need for multiple lenses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lightning Speed Autofocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This camera&#x27;s groundbreaking Fast Hybrid Autofocus system heightens reaction times to incredible new levels. At speeds of up to just 0.03 seconds, precision focussing is instantaneous, and accurate. 315 detection points ensure tenacious tracking of your subject as it moves through the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Zoom Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 25x optical zoom  Zeiss lens features a huge 24-600mm extra wide-angle to ultra-telephoto zoom range with macro capability too. A large F2.4-4 aperture floods the sensor with glorious light detail for high resolution results. Advanced aspherical lens elements and ED glass ensures excellent image quality, resolution and contrast, so it’s equally adept at high clarity and lush bokeh. Optical SteadyShot image stabilisation technology ensures clarity for handheld still and movie shooting, especially in low light, or at the ultra-telephoto end of the zoom range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Fire Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Capture incredible super slow motion videos with the RX10 IV. Shoot as fast as 250 frames per second at Full HD quality, or 1000 fps in PAL mode, which is a stunning 40x slower than natural motion. With an adjustable shutter speed as fast as 1/32000 second and up to 24fps continuous shooting speed, even with AF/AE tracking, you&#x27;ll never miss the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stacked CMOS Sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 20.1MP 1.0 type Exmor RS CMOS sensor delivers outstanding picture quality thanks to a stacked architecture that expands and speeds up signal processing. The BIONZ X image processing engine handles the data with speed and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Distortion Shutter &amp; Silent Shooting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The RX10 IV can suppress distortion when shooting at up to a shutter speed of 1/32000, so you can capture sharp, undistorted images of fast-moving sports action. Its electronic shutter also allows you to shoot silently so you can get in amongst the wildlife and not disturb the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pristine 4K UHD Movies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With high precision 4K recording, the RX10 IV can really take your breath away. Shoot beautiful footage with high-bit-rate recording, and full pixel readout without pixel binning for high-resolution results. A high-speed front-end LSI supports image processing to greatly reduce “rolling shutter”. Together with the Fast Hybrid AF, video footage is beautifully professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLED Viewfinder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With high magnification (0.70x), contrast and resolution, the OLED viewfinder features a resolution equivalent to 2359k dots and corner-to-corner visibility to make it easier to see every detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Triple manual lens rings for focus, zoom and aperture are designed for natural, comfortable control, especially when looking through the viewfinder. A multi interface shoe makes it easy to connect flash units, microphones and accessories, and a dust and moisture-resistant body ensures the camera withstands rugged conditions. The LCD screen tilts to 109 degrees up and 41 degrees down for easier shooting from more awkward angles. And you can focus with your fingertips too. Tactile focus control means you can slide your finger across the touch screen to shift focus, or simply touch the point of the composition you wish to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi &amp; NFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Go anywhere, share anytime. Simply touch the camera against an NFC-enabled smartphone or tablet to activate apps or share photos or movies - no extra cables, no complicated connections.

High Resolution mode captures 80 megapixel equivalent shots for brilliantly-detailed macro work, while easy Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi connection lets you share your work quickly and wirelessly. With an exceptionally clear OLED viewfinder and free angle touch screen, it&#x27;s built for rugged use out in the field with a splashproof, dust proof and freeze-proof body. All this tech unites to make the G9 the supreme outdoor and wildlife camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Image Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its 20.3-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor without low-pass filter captures a superb level of detail, colour and brightness. The Venus Engine processor renders high-precision yet natural images with Multipixel Luminance Generation and Intelligent Detail Processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stunningly Fast Shooting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Super-fast, high precision DFD (depth from defocus) autofocus achieves staggeringly fast AF speed of just 0.04 seconds, so the G9 locks on and never loses the target. And with burst shooting at 20fps with continuous AF, you&#x27;ll capture amazing shots of even the most fast-moving subjects. With a compatible lens, Dual image stabilisation, a combination of Body and Optical stabilisation, compensates for camera shake and blur, up to 6.5 stops. It&#x27;s ideal for optimising telephoto, night-time, and one-handed shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K Movie, 6K Photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Shoot the moving image in hyper-detailed 4K UHD. An amazing level of detail is captured in beautifully smooth motion at up to 60p.  With the brilliant 6K Photo mode, shoot continuously at 30 frames per second and then select the perfect still as an up to 18MP jpeg. It&#x27;s a superb way to get that spot-on split second composition when shooting very fast-moving nature, sports or action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Resolution Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For stunning landscape and close-up macro photography, High Resolution mode delivers 80 megapixel equivalent images in JPEG &amp; RAW format. An incredible level of detail and depth is captured by combining 8 images taken while shifting the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi makes wireless connection with your smart device easy, for instant sharing of your work. A Bluetooth low energy connection maintains a consistent and reliable link with your smart phone or tablet, while using minimal power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough, Resilient Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ideal for shots of the natural world out in the wild, the G9 is built for the outdoor life. Its magnesium alloy body is splash-proof, dust-proof, and freeze-proof down to -10°C. A fully free angle touch screen lets you get the shot no matter how difficult the angle, and provides intuitive touch control. An OLED viewfinder offers an exceptionally clear view with 100% coverage, high magnification ratio of 0.83x (35mm equivalent) and 10,000:1 contrast ratio for supreme visibility.  It also features a double SD card slot supporting high speed UHS-II compatibility. With a smaller and lighter body than a DSLR it&#x27;s ideal for travelling light while not sacrificing image quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenses &amp;amp; Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One of the biggest advantages of this camera is the sheer shooting flexibility on offer. You can use additional lenses to take wide-angle, telephoto, or close-up shots to suit just about any situation. The shorter the focal length (measured in mm), the wider the view will be &amp;ndash; the longer the focal length, the more telescopic the picture. With a selection of interchangeable lenses at your disposal, the creative possibilities are endless. &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/browse/electricals/cameras-camcorders/view-all-lenses/_/N-akc?intcmp&#x3D;eht_productpage_cscs_lenses_180415&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here to browse our selection.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

With 4x optical zoom and 8x intelligent zoom, you can get up close and personal with your surroundings and take down every single detail.

&lt;p&gt;Even when you are in action, the MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) can compensate for any blurring caused. Just a slight hand-shake movement is accurately detected by a sampling frequency of 4,000 times per second. The result is a sharp, clear image which is witness to your venturing abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With simple controls, the camera is easy to use so you can take quick, hassle-free photos. The 3-inch touch screen provides intuitive control over the menus, and allows you to focus on your subject and take the picture with a single tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligent settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Scene Intelligent Auto technology analyses the subject, brightness, colour and movement in the photo you are composing, and uses the information to pick the optimum camera settings so that you get the best results possible.&lt;/p&gt;

35,johnlewis-630ca2aa60148d21eea186d82ad86783,"Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5 Compact System Camera with Leica 12-60mm O.I.S. Interchangeable Lens, 4K UHD , 20.3MP, Wi-Fi, OLED Live Viewfinder, 3.2” LCD Vari-Angle Touch Screen",cameras,pound,"2,099.00",Panasonic,,True,"&lt;p&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s GH5 is an awesomely capable compact system camera. With a larger sensor than its predecessor, refined Venus Engine and more powerful image stabilisation, stills and movies are incredibly detailed and breathtakingly lifelike. Stunning 4K UHD video resolution runs at an ultra-smooth 60p for the first time, and 6K Photo shooting allows you to select that perfect split-second still from a burst file to save as a high-quality image. With super-fast autofocus, a live viewfinder and a highly flexible touch screen, all housed in a rugged body built for the outdoor life, the GH5 delivers unprecedented picture quality in the history of Lumix cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superb Sensor &amp; Venus Engine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At 20.3 megapixels, the Digital LIVE MOS Sensor is 25% bigger than that of the GH4 benefitting superb resolution, image rendering and colour reproduction, while the removal of the low-pass filter maximises the level of detail possible. The refined Venus Engine processor achieves amazing image quality, especially with Natural Texture Expression for breathtakingly lifelike natural tones. It analyses the characteristic and optimally processes each individual pixel for stunning detail, realism and suppression of false colour. High Precision Multi Process Noise Reduction boasts four times the accuracy on the previous model, so visual noise is countered and detail is retained, meaning low-light photos can be clearly shot at high ISOs of 25600. Stills and movies are blur-free: in conjunction with a compatible lens, powerful 5-axis dual image stabilisation compensates for larger, previously uncontrollable movements, making it equivalent to shooting at a maximum 5 stop slower shutter speed. Perfect for telephoto and single-handed use, and all in stunning 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the first time, 4K UHD video runs at up to 60p (i.e. frame refreshes per second) for unbelievably smooth and ultra-detailed footage. It also means you can slow your footage down without losing any fine detail. The sensor and venus engine combine to suppress rolling distortion, while faster quality signal reading ensures every single frame is of outstanding quality. Special film characteristic styles (&#x27;Cinelike D&#x27; and &#x27;Cinelike V&#x27; for example) are available to give your work that authentic film feel, and with no recording duration limit you can go beyond 30 minutes in all settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6K Photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 6K Photo feature allows you to extract an 18MP resolution image from a 6K Burst Shooting File running at 30 frames per second, so you will always master that one perfect split-second moment, in beautifully glorious detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Autofocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using improved Depth from Defocus technology, autofocus is increased on the previous model up to a super-fast 0.05sec at 12 frames per second. So it&#x27;s easy to keep locked onto fast moving subjects and keep them super-sharp. The frame contains 225 focus points, and you can customise a focal group using the thumb joystick. Meanwhile the Post Focus function even makes it possible to select the area of focus after you&#x27;ve taken the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leica Lens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#x27;s supplied with a LEICA DG Vario-Elmarit 12-60mm F2.8-4.0 Power O.I.S. lens. A highly flexible lens, equally adept at framing breathtaking landscapes and mid-telephoto portraits, it captures your work with a stunning clarity, right to the edge of the frame. Power optical image stabilisation ensures images are free of blur, even from large camera shake, so every picture is beautifully crisp, and all distortion is prevented. And with stunning autofocus capability it&#x27;s ideal to do justice to 4K video capture. Splash, dust and freeze-proof it&#x27;s just as tough as, and a perfect companion for, the GH5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live Viewfinder and Vari-angle Touch Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The large OLED Live Viewfinder boasts an amazing magnification ratio of 1.52x (0.76x 35mm camera equivalent), while the rear touch screen achieves approx. 100% field of view and can be positioned at any angle so you can always find the perfect shot, even in the trickiest environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi makes wireless connection with your smart device easy, for instant sharing of your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The GH5 is tough enough to withstand heavy use in the field. Composed of magnesium alloy and joint-sealed, not only is it splash and dust proof, but freeze-proof down to minus 10 degrees celsius. So it&#x27;ll keep delivering incredible imagery through the toughest of photography adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

Working in tandem with the high-speed signal readout of the sensor, the processor reduces the shooting interval to 0.17 sec. and shutter time lag to 0.045 sec. so the camera is ready to react as fast as you, and you never miss the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retro Styles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Film Simulation, you can choose from classic Fujifilm photo styles, and give your pictures varied colour and tone to suit the subject, just like pros did with film.

40,johnlewis-001045cf1c977c5e9c4db4d540662b4b,"Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5 Compact System Camera with Lumix 12-60mm O.I.S. Interchangeable Lens, 4K UHD, 20.3MP, Wi-Fi, OLED Live Viewfinder, 3.2” LCD Vari-Angle Touch Screen",cameras,pound,"1,799.00",Panasonic,,True,"&lt;p&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s GH5 is an awesomely capable compact system camera. With a larger sensor than its predecessor, refined Venus Engine and more powerful image stabilisation, stills and movies are incredibly detailed and breathtakingly lifelike. Stunning 4K UHD video resolution runs at an ultra-smooth 60p for the first time, and 6K Photo shooting allows you to select that perfect split-second still from a burst file to save as a high-quality image. With super-fast autofocus, a live viewfinder and a highly flexible touch screen, all housed in a rugged body built for the outdoor life, the GH5 delivers unprecedented picture quality in the history of Lumix cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superb Sensor &amp; Venus Engine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At 20.3 megapixels, the Digital LIVE MOS Sensor is 25% bigger than that of the GH4 benefitting superb resolution, image rendering and colour reproduction, while the removal of the low-pass filter maximises the level of detail possible. The refined Venus Engine processor achieves amazing image quality, especially with Natural Texture Expression for breathtakingly lifelike natural tones. It analyses the characteristic and optimally processes each individual pixel for stunning detail, realism and suppression of false colour. High Precision Multi Process Noise Reduction boasts four times the accuracy on the previous model, so visual noise is countered and detail is retained, meaning low-light photos can be clearly shot at high ISOs of 25600. Stills and movies are blur-free: in conjunction with a compatible lens, powerful 5-axis dual image stabilisation compensates for larger, previously uncontrollable movements, making it equivalent to shooting at a maximum 5 stop slower shutter speed. Perfect for telephoto and single-handed use, and all in stunning 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the first time, 4K UHD video runs at up to 60p (i.e. frame refreshes per second) for unbelievably smooth and ultra-detailed footage. It also means you can slow your footage down without losing any fine detail. The sensor and venus engine combine to suppress rolling distortion, while faster quality signal reading ensures every single frame is of outstanding quality. Special film characteristic styles (&#x27;Cinelike D&#x27; and &#x27;Cinelike V&#x27; for example) are available to give your work that authentic film feel, and with no recording duration limit you can go beyond 30 minutes in all settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6K Photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 6K Photo feature allows you to extract an 18MP resolution image from a 6K Burst Shooting File running at 30 frames per second, so you will always master that one perfect split-second moment, in beautifully glorious detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Autofocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using improved Depth from Defocus technology, autofocus is increased on the previous model up to a super-fast 0.05sec at 12 frames per second. So it&#x27;s easy to keep locked onto fast moving subjects and keep them super-sharp. The frame contains 225 focus points, and you can customise a focal group using the thumb joystick. Meanwhile the Post Focus function even makes it possible to select the area of focus after you&#x27;ve taken the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lumix Lens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#x27;s supplied with a LUMIX G Vario 12-60mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH Power O.I.S. lens. With a focal length of 12-60mm (24-120mm 35mm equivalent), Power Optical Image Stabilisation to minimise blur, and fast, accurate focussing, it&#x27;s equally adept at pin-sharp stills and 4K video. Splash and dust-proof, this compact and lightweight lens is ideal for getting the best out of the GH5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live Viewfinder and Vari-angle Touch Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The large OLED Live Viewfinder boasts an amazing magnification ratio of 1.52x (0.76x 35mm camera equivalent), while the rear touch screen achieves approx. 100% field of view and can be positioned at any angle so you can always find the perfect shot, even in the trickiest environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi makes wireless connection with your smart device easy, for instant sharing of your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The GH5 is tough enough to withstand heavy use in the field. Composed of magnesium alloy and joint-sealed, not only is it splash and dust proof, but freeze-proof down to minus 10 degrees celsius. So it&#x27;ll keep delivering incredible imagery through the toughest of photography adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenses &amp;amp; Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the biggest advantages of this camera is the sheer shooting flexibility on offer. You can use additional lenses to take wide-angle, telephoto, or close-up shots to suit just about any situation. The shorter the focal length (measured in mm), the wider the view will be &amp;ndash; the longer the focal length, the more telescopic the picture.

And the Post Focus feature allows you to choose the in-focus area after shooting, a neat feature in any photo, but especially handy in macro shooting where fine adjustments have a big effect on the overall image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With built-in Wi-Fi it&#x27;s easy to connect wirelessly with your smart device, for easy sharing of your work.&lt;/p&gt;

Waterproof, freezeproof and shockproof, it&#x27;ll bring back a superb pictorial record of your most extreme escapades. Snap marine life underwater, or even record a movie in spectacularly detailed 4K UHD. Built-in GPS lets you tag each shot with your exact location so you can relive every moment, or share images instantly and wirelessly with built-in Snapbridge via Bluetooth. No matter what the environmental conditions, a bright lens, large sensor, fast autofocus and vibration reduction all combine to make sure your pics and movies are sharp, richly colourful and gloriously detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOUGH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The W300 ensures classy photography in even the harshest conditions. Rigorously tested by Nikon, it&#x27;s waterproof to a depth of 30 metres and freezeproof down to -10°c. Its dustproof body will also tolerate drops from up to 2.4 metres. So you can dive in, go trekking, or hit the slopes without having to worry about the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superb Image Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A bright wide-angle zoom lens coupled with a back-illuminated 16 megapixel CMOS sensor produces superbly vibrant imagery, even in low light or underwater. 5x optical zoom (boosted by 10x Dynamic Fine Zoom) lets you zero in on distant action, or shoot amazing extreme close ups of the natural world in fine detail with Macro mode.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrilling 4K Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Shoot beautifully smooth movie footage in hyper-detailed 4K Ultra High Definition, or Full HD 1080p if you prefer. An AE lock maintains consistency as the light changes (handy when filming underwater), and wind-noise reduction minimises the distorting sound of air movement when shooting in blustery conditions. Or get creative with awesome time-lapse and &#x27;super-lapse&#x27; movie functions for dramatic high-speed sequences of crowds or the elements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPS Location Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With built-in GPS/GLONASS/QZSS tech you can instantly view location, altitude, depth, air pressure and water pressure directly on the camera monitor. So you can geotag each shot and log your adventure with incredible accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Sharing with SnapBridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Share your shots as quickly as you take them with Nikon’s SnapBridge tech. Using Bluetooth low energy (BLE), this camera can be linked to up to 5 smart devices at all times, and automatically transfer content as you shoot it. This way, you won’t need to fiddles with memory cards and cables to get your pictures and videos on social media.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp Shots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fast autofocus and vibration reduction work together to ensure a crisp clarity of image. AF with target finding technology keeps the focus trained on your subject, even in low light or underwater. Meanwhile, Nikons&#x27; five-axis Hybrid Vibration Reduction reduces camera shake so your snaps are always steady, even when you&#x27;re in the heart of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

81,johnlewis-a18520bfef7666a8b988640904dc6a72,"Fujifilm X-T20 Compact System Camera with XC 16-50mm OIS II Lens, 4K Ultra HD, 24.3MP, Wi-Fi, OLED EVF, 3” Tiltable LCD Touch Screen, Silver",cameras,pound,879.00,Fujifilm,,False,"&lt;p&gt;The X-T20 inherits many of the great features of its X-T2 big brother to bring you the superb image clarity and intuitive manual handling of a high-performing compact system camera. A top quality sensor, high speed shooting, sparkling 4K UHD video resolution and fast autofocus make it great for professional quality shots on-the-go. It&#x27;s housed in a more compact, lighter body and finished with an OLED viewfinder and mechanical dials for hands-on control. This is a brilliantly capable camera for superior quality portable photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A 24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III APS-C sensor captures the image in stunning quality. Its highly random pixel array reduces moiré and false colours without the use of an optical low-pass filter. The X-Processor Pro engine, approximately four times faster than the previous model, delivers amazing colour reproduction and tone gradation for stills and videos with high ISO sensitivity and low visual noise, at amazing speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vivid Viewfinder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 2.36 million dot high definition electronic viewfinder lets you capture the shot exactly as you see it, automatically adjusting brightness for ease of viewing, and boasts a magnification ratio of 0.62x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finessed 4K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Recording the moving image in either Full HD or spectacular 4K Ultra HD video means your videos will be of breathtakingly detailed quality. Film simulation modes such as monochrome and documentary options are available while filming, so no need for post-production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Autofocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The power of the processing engine and improved algorithms combine to significantly improve the auto-focus capabilities of the X-T20 over the previous model. It has a larger high-speed and high-precision phase detection AF area, and features a host of autofocus presets to suit the style of shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versatile Lens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s supplied with a versatile 16-50mm zoom lens with maximum aperture f3.5 and a broad focal length ranging from 24mm wide angle to 76mm telephoto (35mm format equivalent). Lightweight and portable, it features fast and silent motor-driven autofocus and optical image stabilisation for reliably crisp handheld image capture. An ideal lens to get the very best out of the X-T20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tilting Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The LCD screen tilts upwards and downwards so you can find the best angle and features touch control for ease-of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Start-up time has been refined to just 0.4 sec. Working in tandem with the high-speed signal readout of the sensor, the processor reduces the shooting interval to 0.25 sec. and shutter time lag to 0.050 sec. so the camera is ready to react as fast as you, and you never miss the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retro Styles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With Film Simulation, you can choose from classic Fujifilm photo styles, and give your pictures varied colour and tone to suit the subject, just like pros did with film. There&#x27;s standard PROVIA, vivid Velvia, and ASTIA with its true-to-life skin tones; PRO Neg.Std and PRO Neg.Hi, which are portrait modes based on professional colour negative film; and Monochrome expression with three different filter effects as well as Sepia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Phone Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With the dedicated &quot;FUJIFILM Camera Remote&quot; app, you can focus and trigger the camera release from your smart phone or tablet. The app not only lets you adjust focus, but also control settings like shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation and ISO sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling Creative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest advantages of this camera is the sheer shooting flexibility on offer. You can use additional lenses to take wide-angle, telephoto, or close-up shots to suit just about any situation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K stills and frames&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The resolution of 4K delivers four times the quality of a high-definition picture which achieves a much higher level of detail. Even if you view the 4K footage on a Full HD TV, the files will still display clear, sharp images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AF Tracking is also possible which recognises the colour, size and motion of the subject. And with Low Light AF, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to focus on subjects in low light situations with Starlight AF capturing stars in the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key features&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Expand your horizons. Ultra Wide 16mm (35mm equivalent) capability allows you to capture stunningly wide vistas for dramatic large-scale imagery of the natural world and the elements.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Incorporates 15 lens elements in 10 groups including 1 aspherical Extra-Low Dispersion lens, 3 aspherical lenses, 2 Extra-Low Dispersion lenses and 1 Ultra High Refactive Index Lens. The result is high resolution, high contrast imagery right to the very edges of the frame, while chromatic aberrations and distortions are reduced, and all from a light and compact design.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Seven aperture blades create a circular diaphragm for beautifully smooth defocussing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Splash-proof, dust-proof and freeze-proof, this lens is specially designed to be tough and resilient enough to excel in outdoor field use, in all conditions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nano Surface Coating has been applied to lenses within the system, reducing reflection and interference across the complete light spectrum. Great for shooting light sources in the dark.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Advanced autofocus performance enables superb quality video footage. Focus transitions are smooth and near-silent, with a precision that makes hyper-detailed 4K resolution sparkle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This lens meets the strict quality standards set by LEICA Camera AG. It assures a quality of resolution, precision and distortion reduction for professional standard results.&lt;/li&gt;

A host of creative features, the power and high performance of a Digital SLR and intuitive, easy control makes it an ideal first venture into the DSLR world. A next generation sensor captures superb image clarity, even in low light and high contrast settings. Supremely fast Live View Autofocus and 6 frames per second continuous shooting deliver razor-sharp reaction times. Shoot movies in stunning Full HD resolution and experiment with smooth focus transitions thanks to Duel Pixel Autofocus. And with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC working together it&#x27;s a breeze to share your creations wirelessly. A Bright Optical Viewfinder, Hi-Res touch screen and learn-as-you-go guided interface finish off a camera that will transform both your photography, and your know-how as you shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.2MP of Sensational Detail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A next generation APS-C sensor packs a 24.2MP image with incredible detail, equally stunning whether portraying bright colours or the darkest shadows. Powered by Canon&#x27;s renowned Digic 7 processor every function is super-fast and super-responsive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Razor-Sharp, Rapid Autofocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With 45 autofocus points throughout the frame, state of the art AF gives you control over which area has pin-sharp clarity, whether you&#x27;re using the viewfinder or the rear screen. The Live View AF system focuses as fast as a staggering 0.03sec for unbelievably responsive snapping. And 6 fps burst shooting means you can cherry-pick that one perfect split-second moment.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optical Viewfinder, Vari-angle Touch Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Compose the shot however you choose. An optical viewfinder centres you at the heart of the photographic experience and provides an incredibly clear view with 95% coverage of the frame. Or experimenting with different angles and perspectives is easy using the Vari-angle touch screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full HD Movie Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1080p resolution gives your movies the Full HD finish for glorious fine detail, while a 60p frame rate ensures smooth and fluid results when the action&#x27;s fast. Experiment with cinematic shallow focus effects, HDR movie mode and time-lapse footage. Dual Pixel CMOS autofocus keeps the subject sharp even as you change position and allows you to create smooth focus transitions from one part of the frame to another. Keeping everything crystal-clear, 5-axis digital stabilisation guards against blur when shooting hand-held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wireless connection with your smart devices is built in. Low energy Bluetooth technology maintains a constant link with your phone or tablet, meaning full Wi-Fi is easily activated, for easy sharing of your data and remote camera control. NFC devices link instantly with one touch connection. &lt;/p&gt;

The 800D is the perfect camera for less seasoned photographers who want to explore the rich rewards of DSLR shooting. Its guided interface teaches the user how camera settings work as you shoot so, not only does your creative photography increase, but your skills and knowledge do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenses and cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the biggest advantages of this camera is the sheer shooting flexibility on offer. You can use additional lenses to take wide-angle, telephoto, or close-up shots to suit just about any situation.

Dual Pixel CMOS AF focuses as quickly and accurately as a DSLR, automatically tracking your subject throughout the frame. Continuous shooting up to 9 fps (7 fps with SERVO autofocus) arms you with a fast firing camera so you always catch those unmissable moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiltable Touch Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A 3&quot; ClearView touch screen (approx 1.04m dots) gives highly accurate representation of the whole frame, and provides intuitive hands-on control. Plus it&#x27;s tiltable 180 degrees up and 45 degrees down, so you can still shoot when a tricky angle is called for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Zoom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For a handheld camcorder, the HF R806’s zoom options are staggering. The 32x Optical Zoom, 1140x Digital Zoom and 57x Advanced Zoom let you capture your subject wherever you are.

Such tech will make sure your shots are as crisp as they can be.&lt;/p&gt;

Sitting behind the lens is a large Exmor R CMOS sensor. This powerful asset makes images pin-sharp and deeply-detailed, while the BIONZ X processor ensures rapid recording. These blend beautifully with Sony’s G wide-angle lens, which lets you dip down to 26.8mm and capture everything in front of you. Complemented by a 30x optical, and 350x digital, zoom, you’ll have the tools to shoot anything with top-quality. Such versatility is perfect for a rich and varied family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super-Smart Autofocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tap into the heart of every shot with the CX625’s whip-smart autofocus (AF). Sony’s fluid Fast Intelligent AF uses contrast-detection to latch onto fast movements. This way, sports and action footage will have even more pop-out brilliance. Furthermore, the Intelligent Auto detects the type of shot (up to 180) you’re going for and optimises settings depending on the scene – even at night. So, you won’t need to tinker with menus to adjust the shot to your surroundings, the camcorder will do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

With such adaptability, this does far more than shoot videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sophisticated Smart Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With built-in Wi-Fi and NFC, you’ll shoot and share with seamless ease. Hook up the camcorder to your smart device and use it as a remote viewfinder, or share your content at the touch of a button. Just tap your NFC-enabled phone or tablet on the CX625, then use the PlayMemories Mobile app (Android) to set-up sequences from otherwise unreachable angles. You can also live-stream events through USTREAM, so you can share special moments in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crystal-Clear Sound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Far too often, beautiful clips are let down by tinny sound. Sony makes sure that never happens with the 5.1 channel surround sound microphone. Taking in deep, rich audio, you’ll capture the atmosphere of each scene and enjoy engrossing surround-sound playback on your home cinema system. Also, with the My Voice Cancelling feature, the user’s voice is made less intense. This way, you can cheer on or talk to subjects without overwhelming the scene’s sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Flair To Your Videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handheld Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 2017 model has been redesigned for supreme handheld use.

The grip also doubles up as a stand for a sturdy base for your shooting. Dust and splash resistant, it’s built for the outdoor life, so you can take it with you and record your adventures like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share &amp; Edit Amazing Moments with the Gear 360 App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

119,johnlewis-fe48cf46df0b9dcd8eff372c6aff3c31,"Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5 Compact System Camera, 4K UHD, 20.3MP, Wi-Fi, OLED Live Viewfinder, 3.2” LCD Vari-Angle Touch Screen, Body Only",cameras,pound,"1,599.00",Panasonic,,True,"&lt;p&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s GH5 is an awesomely capable compact system camera. With a larger sensor than its predecessor, refined Venus Engine and more powerful image stabilisation, stills and movies are incredibly detailed and breathtakingly lifelike. Stunning 4K UHD video resolution runs at an ultra-smooth 60p for the first time, and 6K Photo shooting allows you to select that perfect split-second still from a burst file to save as a high-quality image. With super-fast autofocus, a live viewfinder and a highly flexible touch screen, all housed in a rugged body built for the outdoor life, the GH5 delivers unprecedented picture quality in the history of Lumix cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superb Sensor &amp; Venus Engine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At 20.3 megapixels, the Digital LIVE MOS Sensor is 25% bigger than that of the GH4 benefitting superb resolution, image rendering and colour reproduction, while the removal of the low-pass filter maximises the level of detail possible. The refined Venus Engine processor achieves amazing image quality, especially with Natural Texture Expression for breathtakingly lifelike natural tones. It analyses the characteristic and optimally processes each individual pixel for stunning detail, realism and suppression of false colour. High Precision Multi Process Noise Reduction boasts four times the accuracy on the previous model, so visual noise is countered and detail is retained, meaning low-light photos can be clearly shot at high ISOs of 25600. Stills and movies are blur-free: in conjunction with a compatible lens, powerful 5-axis dual image stabilisation compensates for larger, previously uncontrollable movements, making it equivalent to shooting at a maximum 5 stop slower shutter speed. Perfect for telephoto and single-handed use, and all in stunning 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the first time, 4K UHD video runs at up to 60p (i.e. frame refreshes per second) for unbelievably smooth and ultra-detailed footage. It also means you can slow your footage down without losing any fine detail. The sensor and venus engine combine to suppress rolling distortion, while faster quality signal reading ensures every single frame is of outstanding quality. Special film characteristic styles (&#x27;Cinelike D&#x27; and &#x27;Cinelike V&#x27; for example) are available to give your work that authentic film feel, and with no recording duration limit you can go beyond 30 minutes in all settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6K Photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 6K Photo feature allows you to extract an 18MP resolution image from a 6K Burst Shooting File running at 30 frames per second, so you will always master that one perfect split-second moment, in beautifully glorious detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Autofocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using improved Depth from Defocus technology, autofocus is increased on the previous model up to a super-fast 0.05sec at 12 frames per second. So it&#x27;s easy to keep locked onto fast moving subjects and keep them super-sharp. The frame contains 225 focus points, and you can customise a focal group using the thumb joystick. Meanwhile the Post Focus function even makes it possible to select the area of focus after you&#x27;ve taken the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live Viewfinder and Vari-angle Touch Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The large OLED Live Viewfinder boasts an amazing magnification ratio of 1.52x (0.76x 35mm camera equivalent), while the rear touch screen achieves approx. 100% field of view and can be positioned at any angle so you can always find the perfect shot, even in the trickiest environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi makes wireless connection with your smart device easy, for instant sharing of your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The GH5 is tough enough to withstand heavy use in the field. Composed of magnesium alloy and joint-sealed, not only is it splash and dust proof, but freeze-proof down to minus 10 degrees celsius. So it&#x27;ll keep delivering incredible imagery through the toughest of photography adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

Shoot beautiful footage with high-bit-rate recording, and full pixel readout without pixel binning for high-resolution results. A high-speed front-end LSI supports image processing to greatly reduce “rolling shutter”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With Fast Intelligent Auto Focus, The RX10 III focuses at speeds of up to 0.09 seconds. A subject detection algorithm accurately predicts the point of focus before the shutter is pressed halfway, so the camera focuses at the very moment the button is pressed. So it’s easier for you to pick up the camera, press the shutter and get that shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLED Viewfinder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With high magnification (0.70x), contrast and resolution, the OLED viewfinder features a resolution equivalent to 2359k dots and corner-to-corner visibility to make it easier to see every detail of your subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intuitive Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Manual lens rings for focus, zoom and aperture are designed for natural, comfortable control, especially when looking through the viewfinder. A multi interface shoe makes it easy to connect flash units, microphones and accessories. A dust and moisture-resistant body ensures the camera withstands rugged conditions. And an adjustable screen gives you the flexibility to capture the shot from more angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi &amp; NFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Go anywhere, share anytime. Simply touch the camera against an NFC-enabled smartphone or tablet to activate apps or share photos or movies - no extra cables, no complicated connections. Use built-in Wi-Fi to upload to social networks or connect to a PC or TV, and Sony’s PlayMemories Apps are available to download to enhance your creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K Recording&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Record rich data in a 4K resolution with full pixel readout and no pixel binning.

Its Advanced Multi-CAM 3500 II autofocus sensor module achieves outstanding focus detection, even at a very dim -3 EV (ISO 100, 20ºC/68ºF). Its high-density 51 focus points cover a wide area of the frame in DX format and most of the frame in 1.3x Crop Mode, while 15 cross-type sensors in the centre provide higher detection strength. One centre AF point can even work all the way to f/8, which is great when using teleconverters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full HD video recording&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capture HD video at a frame rate of 60p with tack-sharp details, vibrant colours and high-fidelity stereo sound. The improved full-time autofocus will keep moving subjects sharp. And, the advanced Picture Controls like Flat and Clarity make it easier to perfect your movies in post-production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-lapse movies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment and create beautifully rendered time-lapse movies with smooth exposure variations entirely in camera. Make smooth exposure transitions with Auto ISO while monitoring with Highlight Display (Zebra Stripes) and even apply Flat Picture Control for easier colour grading in post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective expression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn your images into artistic master pieces with next-generation Picture Controls and a collection of Image Effects – the latter can even be applied to photos and videos in real time. Preserve the details in highlights and shadows, even when the scene includes moving subjects with Active D-lighting and, set white balance simply by selecting the area of the frame that should be white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenses &amp;amp; Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest advantages of this camera is the sheer shooting flexibility on offer. You can use additional lenses to take wide-angle, telephoto, or close-up shots to suit just about any situation.

With a winning combination of cutting-edge operations and a robust, ergonomic design, it is optimized to make even the most challenging photography simple and easy. The EOS 7D Mark II features a refined APS-C sized 20.2 Megapixel CMOS sensor with Dual DIGIC 6 Image Processors for gorgeous imagery. It shoots up to 10 frames per second at ISOs ranging from 100–16000 (expandable to H1: 25600, H2: 51200), has a 65-point all cross-type AF system and features Canon&#x27;s amazing Dual Pixel CMOS AF for brilliant Live-View AF.

With super quick AF and exposure systems complementing the shutter&#x27;s 55 msec shutter release time lag, the EOS 7D Mark II is tailored to meet and even exceed the speed of the action. Refined mechanics like a newly designed, more efficient shutter-drive motor and a vibration dampened mirror drive mean impressive performance for high caliber image quality, fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;65 point AF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br / &gt;An EOS first, the EOS 7D Mark II features 65 all cross-type AF points for high precision AF at remarkable speed. Cross-type AF points ensure stable AF that is not influenced by the subject&#x27;s shape or color. On theEOS 7D Mark II, the AF points are spread over a wide area of the frame, enabling faster AF, wherever the subject lies. With a central dual cross-type AF point of f/2.8, AF is enhanced with lenses faster than f/2.8.

Displaying approximately 100% of the composition, the viewfinder can show settings like shooting mode, exposure level, white balance, drive mode, AF operation, metering mode, recording format, even an electronic level and more. All of this information can be displayed by or superimposed easily over the image for review while shooting, and multiple views are customizable through the EOS 7D Mark II&#x27;s simple user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br / &gt;Ideal for travel or nature photography, the EOS 7D Mark II&#x27;s built-in GPS can record longitude, latitude and altitude data as EXIF data, can track movement at set intervals with its logging function, and can even set the camera&#x27;s internal clock to local time! When using the logger function on a computer, you will see the exact route you travelled, and the map will show you where and when you took each image.&lt;/p&gt;

Simultaneously photo capture while shooting a Full HD movie. Shoot stills with 16.1 million effective pixels and enjoy high-speed burst shooting to capture fast-moving subjects in a sequence so you never miss a moment.&lt;/br&gt;
The E-M10 Mark II supports full high-definition (1920 x 1080) pixels for more beautiful movies. Its compact design facilitates hand-held recording, and it also solves the problem of large sized video files with the innovative CLIPS feature. This means that you can shoot short clips, edit them into a single portable video and share at leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Delivering one of the most refined forms of image stabilization is the Olympus 5-axis Image Stabilization. This neutralises camera movement by producing razor sharp images, flawless hand-held low light shots and super smooth video.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing is believing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Holding the first OLED viewfinder in the OM-D family, this Olympus camera offers up ease of use. The OM-D E-M10 Mark II’s OLED electronic viewfinder allows you to see any changes to the camera settings, such as the new AF targeting pad. With this you can keep your eye on the viewfinder as you trace your thumb on the rear touchscreen to adjust focus points.&lt;/br&gt;
The intuitive 3-inch tilting touchscreen can release the camera’s shutter with just a ‘tap’. It can even let you alter settings and add creative effects while you’re recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classic yet modern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Encasing all the components to take a quality image is a sturdy metal body, wrapped up in refined leather. Metal dials with classic design elements set the OM-D E-M10 Mark II apart from the rest. While controls and other features such as a prominent thumb pad, have been carefully considered so you can operate the camera without taking your eye of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reveal your creative flair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Experiment with one of 14 Art Filters including Grainy Film and Partial Colour, or use Photo Story to combine multiple images using one of five layouts. Apply the effects before you shoot with Live View or to a finished image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenses and cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the biggest advantages of this camera is the sheer shooting flexibility on offer. You can use additional lenses to take wide-angle, telephoto, or close-up shots to suit just about any situation. The shorter the focal length (measured in mm), the wider the view will be; the longer the focal length, the more telescopic the picture.
