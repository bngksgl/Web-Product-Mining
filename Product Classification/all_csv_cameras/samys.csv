samys-03d1554a8301c950d1fda29829af9d77,X-T2 Mirrorless Digital Camera Body,USD,1599.00,Fujifilm,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The Fujifilm X-T2 Mirrorless Digital Camera Body takes the FUJIFILM X mirrorless camera  system to a whole new level of excellence.  With its 24.3MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS III sensor and high-performance X  Processor Pro image processing engine, the X-T2 fulfills  the high standards of the FUJIFILM X system. The addition of 4K/2K video  takes it one step beyond. With a string of features  including high speed 1/32000 shutter, Intelligent Hybrid Phase detection  AF, weather resistant body, 3-way tilting 3.0” LCD, 2.36  Million dots EVF and dual SD UHS-II memory card slots, the X-T2 makes a  fitting successor to the popular FUJIFILM X-T1.FEATURES:24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III Sensor - The FUJIFILM X-T2 features a 24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III APS-C sensor for  outstanding image quality. Its highly random pixel array effectively  reduces moiré and false colors without the use of an optical low-pass  filter. When combined with an XF lens, the sensor delivers images with a  perceived resolution far greater than the number of pixels used. Other  features include outstanding read speed, high-speed continuous shooting,  high-precision AF tracking, highly faster liveview refresh rate and  superb video recording.Excellent image processing from X-Processor Pro - The X-Processor Pro image processing engine is approximately four times  faster than the previous model. The increased built-in memory and  enhanced computational power bring out the maximum capabilities of the  X-Trans CMOS III sensor. It produces high quality images and improves  response times for shorter delays between shots, reduced shutter-release  time lag and greater AF precision. The engine also delivers faster Live  View refresh rates and reduces image delay when tracking moving  subjects.Larger high-speed and high-precision phase detection AF area coupled with performance improvements - AF performance has been improved in a number of keys areas. The fast  and accurate phase detection AF now covers a larger part of the frame  and has been optimized in the area where users are most likely to  position the main subject. At the same time, the FUJIFILM X-T2 boasts  significant focusing improvements on small highlights, low contrast  subjects and subjects with fine textures, which have previously caused  problems for focal plane phase detection AF. Contrast detection AF,  which excels in low light conditions, has also received a performance  boost, with the ability to accurately focus in light levels as low as  -3EV. The camera also refocuses more regularly during the slow burst  mode in AF-C.Eye Detection AF automatically detects human eyes - Choose  Face Detection to automatically detect human faces, or turn on Eye  Detection AF to automatically detect and accurately focus on human eyes  for successful portraits with a shallow depth of field. You can also  define the area of priority focus, for example right or left eye, or the  eye closer to the camera. These functions have been upgraded for  improved accuracy to a level that will impress professional  photographers. They are particularly effective when shooting with the  XF56mmF1.2 R / XF56mmF1.2 R APD or XF90mmF2 R LM WR lenses.Pinpoint accurate focusing in MF mode - The FUJIFILM X-T2 has a variety of functions that assist pinpoint  focusing in the MF mode. Set the Focus Mode Lever to MF and rotate the  focus ring to access a variety of MF Assist functions. These include  Focus Peaking, in which color is used to show the parts of the image  that are in focus, and Digital Split Image, where focus is achieved by  lining up the split image strips in the center. These features are  particularly useful in macro photography and portraiture, which involve a  shallow depth of field and require focusing precision.Focus Lever to instantly change the focusing point - The focus area can be changed in eight directions using the FUJIFILM  X-T2's Focus Lever: up/down, right/left and diagonally. This allows  users to make quick changes to the focus area for accurate focusing  after composing an image. This feature is useful not only to shift the  AF points during autofocusing, but also to quickly choose the area to be  enlarged in MF Assist mode during manual focusing.Three parameters controlling AF-C - Fujifilm has substantially improved the AF-C algorithm to boost the  accuracy of the FUJIFILM X-T2's ability to track moving subjects. You  can now fine tune how the camera reacts to the way the subject moves  within the frame, how fast the subject moves and where in the frame the  camera prioritizes focus. The five presets in the AF-C Custom Settings  represent combinations of these three factors.AF-C Custom Settings - The AF-C Custom Setting allows you to select one of five AF presets  according to the subject's movements to obtain perfect focus tracking.  Based on how the subject moves, you can select a preset from, for  example, Preset 2: Ignoring obstacles, Preset 3: For subjects that  accelerate / decelerate, Preset 4: For subjects that suddenly come into  the frame or Preset 5: Subjects with erratic movements to obtain optimum  settings for accurate subject tracking. A combination of three factors:  Tracking sensitivity, Speed tracking sensitivity and Zone area  switching, may be manually set and registered as Preset 6: Custom.High-resolution Real Time Viewfinder with a 0.77x magnification ratio - The 2.36-million-dot high-resolution organic EL electronic viewfinder  has a magnification ratio of 0.77x, a horizontal viewing angle of 31  degrees, and a display time lag of just 0.005 seconds. The viewfinder,  which is 2 times brighter than the previous model, also features an  automatic brightness adjustment function so it's easy to see in all  conditions - even intense backlighting. It completely eliminates moiré  or false colors, and boasts performance comparable to an optical  viewfinder, but with the added advantage of displaying a live view that  reflects exposure settings.Up to 100 fps EVF refresh rate for a clear display even in low light - As standard, the EVF refreshes at a rate of 60 fps, but in Boost mode  this jumps to 100fps, which continuously displays even fast-moving  subjects smoothly to deliver a performance comparable to that of an  optical viewfinder. The fast refresh rate is maintained even in low  light for easy framing during night shooting.Focusing on subjects with erratic movements - Continuous  shooting performance has also been improved, enabling up to 11fps when  using the mechanical shutter* and 5fps in the Live View mode. The  viewfinder blackout time is now less than half that of the previous  model. This means that you can track a fast-moving subject more easily  for an extended period of time during continuous shooting. The  combination of advanced continuous shooting options and EVF performance  deliver continuous AF-C shooting never previously thought possible with  mirrorless cameras.Film Simulation on video recording - Film Simulation modes are available during video recording. Movie  shooters can enjoy extra creativity, without the need for lengthy  post-production, including monochrome video in ACROS and  documentary-themed tones in CLASSIC CHROME. You can also change settings  such as aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation while  recording video.Simultaneous HDMI output to an external monitor - Video can be output via HDMI during recording, allowing you to  simultaneously check footage on the camera's LCD monitor or EVF and an  external monitor. The data can even be recorded onto an external  recorder as you film in the uncompressed format. As for 4K movie, you  can choose log gamma ""F-Log"" to record a wider dynamic range than normal  video mode.Solid body with resistance to dust, moisture and low temperatures - The  FUJIFILM X-T2's body is made of magnesium alloy. Despite being compact  and lightweight, it is both solid and highly durable. The body is also  weather-sealed in 63 points to achieve a high level of resistance to  dust and moisture. Couple this with its ability to work in temperatures  down to -10°C and you'll see the camera is ready for anything. Similar  weather-sealing is applied to the dust-resistant and water-resistant  lenses and the Power Booster Grip to provide weather resistance across  the entire system.Exceptionally balanced for a comfortable and reliable grip - The FUJIFILM X-T1's grip has been further developed and now offers even  greater comfort on the FUJIFILM X-T2 thanks to a larger area set aside  as a thumb rest. Locking mechanisms have also been introduced for the SD  Card Cover and Battery Cover.Three-direction tilting LCD screen - The  FUJIFILM X-T2 features a premium LCD screen that can tilt in three  directions. Tilt it up and down when shooting in landscape, and upward  when shooting in portrait. The screen remains positioned on the optical  axis of the lens for easier high-angle and low-angle shooting. The  3-inch LCD has 1.04 million dots and uses toughened glass. When not  tilted, it fits flush to the body.Lockable dials deliver quick and simple handling - Key exposure controls are dial-based, such as setting the shutter  speed, ISO sensitivity, exposure compensation, Drive Mode and Metering  Mode. This means settings can easily be changed, even when the camera is  turned off. Selected controls also feature lock and release buttons to  enhance overall operation.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-046466x1500.jpg,,,,,,,

The sun dropping over the horizon, boats navigating a harbor, cars twisting through streets during rush hour can all be compressed in time, while maintaining gorgeous image quality. Movement appears fast, like reality has been accelerated. Intervals of 1- to 30-seconds between photos are available.Panning allows the camera to lock onto the main subject using IS and automatically adjust the shutter speed for beautiful background blur - By using a slow shutter speed and Canon’s advanced image stabilization, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera’s Panning mode can help you capture fast-moving subjects in an artistic and striking fashion.

For one thing, it was medium-format cameras that NASA's astronauts took with them as they first explored the frontiers of space.

An Affordable Automatic 120 Panoramic Camera: Carrying on the tradition of its distant cousin, the LOMO LC-A+, the Belair X 6-12 Jetsetter boasts an automatic shutter system that makes shooting perfectly-exposed photos as easy as clicking the shutter - and all this on 120 film! The expansive 6x12 format allows you to capture a vast space that makes for jaw-dropping photos; whether landscape, portrait or anything else you feel like shooting. Wait there's more; the Belair X 6-12 can also shoot in both square 6x6 and regular 6x9 formats. So whatever shape you're in, the Belair X 6-12 is ready to match you!

Automatic Exposure Shutter: Carrying on the tradition of its distant cousin, the LOMO LC-A+, the Belair X 6-12 camera boasts an electronic automatic shutter. This means that just like with the LOMO LC-A+, the correct film sensitivity needs to be set so that photos turn out neither dark, nor overexposed. Whilst the LOMO LC-A+ shutter closes only once there is enough light, the Belair X 6-12's auto-exposure range is EV4 - EV15 and this is calculated just before the shutter is released.  The minimum recommended conditions when shooting in dim light with the Belair X 6-12 are ISO/ASA dial set to 100 with 100 ISO film. If you're after brighter results in a dark setting, a high ISO film or switching to B (Bulb) Mode is recommended. B Mode will expose your shot for as long as you keep the shutter pressed.

It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor The PowerShot N2 camera employs a Canon 16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor to capture precious moments in the quality they deserve. Delivering state-of-the-art imaging performance and optimized for use in compact cameras, the sensor utilizes a sophisticated light-capturing design to provide high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise.

With the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. And video recording is better than ever, as the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables Full HD in MP4 format. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices.Canon HS SYSTEM Helps Provide Excellent Low-light PerformanceThe PowerShot N2 camera features the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM to capture the moment with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance.

For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video. Smart AUTOSmart AUTO on the PowerShot N2 camera makes capturing sharp, bright, colorful images and video as simple as pressing the shutter button. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results.

Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects and landscapes in the evening or on a bright, snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as ""keeper"" shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot N2 ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.USB ChargingThe PowerShot N2 camera can be recharged via a convenient USB cable.

Its high resolving power adopts the same gapless on-chip lens structure as the a7R and features the latest-generation RGB color filter and other cutting-edge device technologies developed by Sony, the number 1 manufacturer of image sensors. The a77II's image sensor exhibits approximately 20% higher sensitivity and lower noise levels compared to the a77 throughout a wide sensitivity range of ISO 100 to 25,600.The a77II is equipped with the same BIONZ(r) X image processing engine as on the top-of-the-line full-frame models-a7 and a7R. This engine achieves approximately three times the processing speed of previous BIONZ and features all the latest image processing technologies, which are optimized for this model. The result is astonishingly high-speed processing capabilities as well as faithfully reproduced textures and amazing definition.The a77II has the world's fastest continuous shooting speed in its class-up to 12 frames per second at full resolution. Equipped with a 79 point AF sensor and advanced auto focus tracking, technology, you never have to miss a moment. The a77II outperforms even more expensive rivals with continuous auto focus and auto exposure when shooting at 12fps at full 24.3MP resolution and can capture up to 60 frames in a single burst when in JPEG fine setting.The a77II is also equipped with a newly developed phase detection auto focus system, featuring wide coverage 79 AF points. Fifteen of the AF points are cross-type and placed in the most-frequently-used central area of the sensor. This helps the a77II achieve accurate focusing even with horizontally striped subjects, which line-type AF points typically find challenging. The new AF system also performs well in low-light conditions-as low as EV -2 (ISO 100), which is similar to a moonlit night under which objects are difficult to see even with the naked eye. The new AF algorithm instantly recognizes and reliably tracks the desired subject. The a77II also realizes impressive focusing accuracy, even when a large-aperture lens is mounted, thanks to the f/2.8 AF point placed horizontally in the center of the AF sensor overlapping another AF point.Strong outlines a common characteristic of digital images, are minimized as much as possible to achieve finely detailed images with a natural three-dimensional appearance and naturally depicts subjects as seen by human vision. This increases the ability to depict detailed textures and brings photography another step closer to creating totally realistic, high-quality images. Diffraction-reducing technology maximizes the optical performance of lenses and produces finer details when shooting with a small aperture setting. Optimal filter processing-that best matches the f-number-is applied to correct image points that are blurred, preventing diffraction effects that become an issue when shooting with a deep depth of field and high pixel count. You can therefore depend on finely detailed images even when shooting with a small aperture setting. The a77II has a wide sensitivity range of ISO 100 to 25,600 for faster shutter speeds and low-light shooting situations. Combined with detail reproduction technology, area-specific noise reduction effectively suppresses noise and realizes high-sensitivity images resulting in fine details and less grain from corner to corner. Connectivity with smartphones has been simplified with Wi-Fi(r) and NFC control for one-touch sharing. Simply tap the camera to another NFC-enabled device like a tablet or smartphone and photos are transferred with just one touch. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required.

Vari-angle Touch Screen, 3.0-inch LCD - The EOS 77D camera comes with a Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD II monitor. It excels at shooting stills and videos at a variety of angles, as well as moviemaking whether used with a tripod or handheld. During Live View, tap the screen where you want to focus, and thanks to Dual Pixel CMOS AF the camera will focus on that location almost instantly. Two-finger touch gestures can be used for zooming or changing images after you’ve taken them, and menu and quick control settings can be accessed quickly and easily. With 1.04 million dots the screen is highly detailed and treated with a smudge-resistant coating to help minimize fingerprints and maintain a clear image, even in bright light.7560-pixel RGB+IR Metering Sensor - A fine-tuned RGB+IR metering sensor not only helps ensure accurate exposure, but also uses Color Detection AF to detect skin tones and help provide precise AF. This is particularly useful when establishing focus for portraits in situations where other AF systems may falter. When a skin tone is detected, AI Servo AF starts off on skin-colored points, then tracks the subject based of the original AF point’s color information, maintaining focus on the person even when they’re in motion.Anti-flicker Shooting - The EOS 77D camera features a flicker detection system that not only alerts the user in the viewfinder, but with the camera’s Anti-flicker Shooting function can compensate for flickering light sources, taking shots as close to peak light volume as possible. This feature is useful for helping to minimize disparities in color and exposure, especially during continuous shooting in sub-optimal lighting situations.Movie Electronic IS - Camera shake is inevitable at times, whether you’re ready to record the game-winning goal while running to keep up with the players, or when the landscape is epic but you’re riding in the car on a bumpy road. Movie Electronic IS^^^ helps minimize image blur due to shake, even when recording Full HD videos. When enabled and used with a compatible lens, 5-axis stabilization helps minimize image blur in the horizontal, vertical, and rotational planes.HDR Movie & Time-Lapse Movie - HDR Movie mode captures correctly exposed and under-exposed images, then blends them into one video with more highlight detail for stunning results. Time-Lapse Movie mode takes long stretches of time and condenses it down to a single high-speed video (minimum settable shutter speed of 1/25). Rapidly moving pedestrians on a busy street, fast-moving clouds in the sky – the possibilities are only limited by your imagination.High-speed Continuous Shooting at up to 6.0 fps - The more images, the better. That’s the idea behind the EOS 77D camera’s ability to capture up to 6.0 frames per second. Whether you’re capturing a majestic bird taking flight or a pro athlete scoring a winning goal, the EOS 77D can take the shot and stay locked on throughout the action, ensuring you capture the exact moment you want.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-050588x1500_1.jpg,,,,,,,
samys-170e60947eb1ea385285951c2f040270,dp1 Quattro Digital Camera,USD,899.00,Sigma,,http://schema.org/InStock,"Redesigned in every aspect, including the sensor, engine, lens and body, the Sigma dp1 Quattro Digital Camera embodies Sigma's philosophy of creating cameras that produce works of art. The Sigma dp1 is the second camera in the new Quattro series to be released, with the dp2 currently available and the dp3 Quattro to follow. combines the 29MP Foveon X3 Direct Image Sensor with the TRUE III image processing engine to create high quality images with an equivalent resolution of 39 megapixels due to the unique sensor design. This method uses layers of pixels to capture the color data of the red, green, and blue spectrums vertically, requiring no interpolation. This results in a sharper image with better color gradations. With this technology is a 19mm lens that on an APS-C camera has an 35mm equivalent focal length of 28mm. It is relatively fast with a maximum aperture of f/2.8, making it useful in low light. Also, for composing and reviewing images, a 3.0"" 920k-dot TFT LCD display is available on the back of the camera. For low light shooting, the camera has an ISO sensitivity range of 100-6400 in 1/3 steps and it has P/S/A/M shooting modes for full control over your exposure. It even has RAW image capture at a max resolution of 5,424 x 3,616 for excellent editing capabilities. For focusing, there is contrast-detect autofocus or a manual focusing ring for your preference. And, the camera saves your images to an SDXC, SDHC, or SD card.The dp1 uses the APS-C-sized Foveon X3 CMOS image sensor which captures color information vertically as opposed to horizontally. This means that each pixel has extremely accurate color information, resulting in rich tones and smooth gradations. Also, since it captures color vertically, there is no need for color filters or a low-pass filter, further increasing image quality for resolution comparable to about 39MP from Bayer array image sensors. This camera utilizes the latest generation of this technology, named Quattro due to the 1:1:4 ratio of the pixel layers, with 20MP on the top layer and 4.9MP on each of the bottom two. This simultaneously reduces file size and increases resolution, making the camera faster and lowers the power consumption. This speed increase is also due to the third generation Three-layer Responsive Ultimate Engine, or TRUE III image processing engine. The processor is optimized for handling the complex image data recorded by the sensor and produces high quality imagery. resolution, making the camera faster and lowers the power consumption.

samys-1aca849ade415f7b7b646a73028b1c66,M Monochrom Typ 246 Digital Rangefinder Camera,USD,7550.00,Leica,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The Leica M Monochrom (Typ 246), is the first and only  Digital Rangefinder Camera that captures a real black and white image, still or  moving. Reduced to the essentials for true, authentic and direct black  and white photography, the Leica M Monochrom offers unparalleled image  performance, outstanding low light capabilities and rich details. FEATURES: 

The next level - Photographers who consciously employ the unique aesthetics of black-and-white photography to express their creativity can rely on the Leica M Monochrom as a modern tool. As the successor to the world’s first digital black-and-white camera, it offers the latest technologies to support creative visualization in its archetypal form. For pictures of unequalled quality. For pictures with previously unimaginable sharpness, depth and clarity. A pioneer in every respect. A true Leica.


Instantaneous response - Black-and-white photography with unrivalled speed: with the Leica Maestro (video/image processor), the Leica M Monochrom not only features the same high-performance processor as its counterpart with color vision, the Leica M, but also offers the extra speed reserves of a 2 GB buffer memory. This enables sequential shooting at three times the speed of the previous model – with pictures in the exceptional M quality photographers expect. The pictures are instantaneously available for display in review mode and written as JPEG files and/or RAW data in DNG format to the memory card.


See more - Leica M Monochrom – the sharpest way to see things in black and white: thanks to a high-resolution 24-megapixel sensor that captures images in 35 mm full-frame format – with three times the speed of its predecessor. As the sensor records only luminance values, this leads to 100% sharper pictures with an exceptional depth, clarity and resolution of details that by far exceed those of color exposures – even when shooting with the highest ISO sensitivity settings. Pictures that already satisfy professional demands in JPEG format.


A discreet delight - Discreet and solidly built, the Leica M Monochrom brings all the essentials anyone could ever need for unobtrusive photography – to last a lifetime, if you wish. Its endurance is guaranteed by the superior quality and solidity of the materials that go into its construction – top deck and baseplate are machined from solid brass and the camera body is engineered from high-strength magnesium alloy. Equally hard-wearing is the extremely scratch-resistant and almost unbreakable sapphire glass cover plate for its LCD monitor. This reduction to the essentials is what makes it a true Leica.


As if painted with light - The omission of color filters in front of the sensor allows more light to reach its surface. More light for aesthetic, pin-sharp and finely resolved exposures at sensitivities up to ISO 25000. Pictures that possess a finely grained noise signature at the highest ISO values that are reminiscent of the look of analogue photos. Thanks to the combination of low susceptibility to noise, a bright viewfinder/rangefinder, a low-vibration shutter release and fast lenses, the Leica M Monochrom opens up entirely new dimensions for available-light photography.


Creative contrasts - By modifying the conversion of colors to grey scale values, yellow, green and orange lens filters – calculated especially for use with the Leica M Monochrom – offer new opportunities for the exploration of creative effects with light and contrast. This means that the color of the filter in the original scene becomes brighter and its complementary color darker. This is effective for creating unusual moods in landscapes, portraits and other genres of photography. At the same time, multi-layer coating reduces reflections and ensures high transmission without vignetting.


Full visual control with Live View - In Live View mode, the high-resolution 3"" monitor with a resolution of 921,600 pixels enables complete control of composition, framing, exposure, focusing and depth of field. Live View also offers two additional focusing methods: Live View Zoom for tenfold magnification of the scene or subject, and Focus Peaking, which automatically marks the edges of objects in color when they are sharply focused. All leading to the same destination: pictures with exceptional sharpness.


Moving pictures in M quality - Video at the press of a button: the Leica M Monochrom has a separate release button for activating video recording in 1080p full-HD format. Thanks to a dedicated adapter, the legendary R-series lenses can also be used for recording video with all available functions. Perfect sound is ensured by an optional Leica microphone adapter set, comprising an adapter and a stereo microphone.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-038465x600.jpg,,,,,,,

Perfection means creating a system that allows photographers to control, frame, and create with style, ease, and purpose. A long-anticipated iteration of the X100 series, the FUJIFILM X100F is a powerful addition to FUJIFILM X Series, offering photographers the versatility of endless creativity.FEATURES:Newly Developed APS-C Sensor, X-Trans CMOS III - The Fujifilm X100F features the X-Trans CMOS III sensor specifically designed for the X Series. The X-Trans CMOS III uses an aperiodic color filter array to eliminate the need for an optical low-pass filter. The 24.3MP APS-C sensor controls noise beautifully despite its increased pixel count, allowing the standard sensitivity range to be boosted to ISO12800, which was in the extended sensitivity range in previous models. Additionally, the phase detection area has been expanded to enable phase detection AF, allowing the camera to function with greater speed and accuracy than ever before.    All New Engine, X-Processor Pro - The Fujifilm X100F uses newly developed X-Processor Pro as its image processing engine, achieving processing speeds of about 4 times faster than previous models. It draws out the full capability of the X-Trans CMOS III sensor which supports high-speed data read to dramatically improve response time. The X-Processor Pro also helps display a moving subject more smoothly, thanks to the improvement of the refresh rate to 60fps for the LCD monitor and EVF's Live View mode. The engine has reduced the camera's startup time to approx. 0.5 seconds, shortening the time required from powering on to shooting - so you won't miss a beat.    Expanded Phase Detection AF Area - The Fujifilm X100F features phase detection AF using phase detection pixels on the sensor. The phase detection area on the sensor has been increased by approx. 230% as compared to previous models. The camera uses 91 focus points (up to 325 points) for high-speed and high-accuracy focusing as compared to 49 points in previous models The AF algorithm itself has been revised to ensure accurate focusing even in difficult conditions such as low-contrast scenes in overcast weather.    Built-In ISO Dial - New features in the Fujifilm X100F include the Built-In ISO Dial, incorporated into the Shutter Speed Dial reminiscent of film cameras of yesteryear, the focus lever, which allows you to instantaneously move the focus area without having to take your eye off the viewfinder, and the 'C' position for enabling ±5 stop exposure compensation. Most of the operation-related buttons and dials are concentrated on the right-hand side to allow quick change of settings while firmly holding the camera.Focus Lever For Quick Selection Of Focus Areas - The Fujifilm X100F is the first lens-integrated X Series camera that features the Focus Lever. It moves in eight directions (up / down, right / left and diagonally) so that you can swiftly move your AF point selection while maintaining composition.    Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder - The Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder combines the features of an optical viewfinder (OVF) and electronic viewfinder (EVF). Operate the viewfinder switch lever at the front of the camera body to instantly switch between OVF and EVF. You can also apply the electronic display which shows a focus area over the OVF screen to take advantage of Focus Peaking and Digital Split Image functions even in the OVF mode for accurate focusing in real time.The Electronic Rangefinder shows the EVF in a small window at the bottom right corner of the OVF. The EVF in the ERF mode has 100% finder coverage and can display a focus area in 2.5x and 6x magnification. While composing with the OVF, you can check the EVF window for exposure, white balance and other details to be reflected in your actual pictures. Use the MF Assist function for highly accurate manual focusing.    Real Time Parallax Correction - Parallax, i.e. a displacement of the shooting frame in the viewfinder from the actual area to be photographed especially in close-ups, is automatically corrected in real time. Even in OVF mode, the X100F automatically corrects the position of the shooting frame and focus area upon focusing, and displays them correctly for more accurate composition.    'C' Position For Enabling ±5-Step Exposure Compensation - The ergonomically placed exposure compensation dial supports compensation of up to ±3-step in 1/3 steps. Put the dial into 'C' position and operate the Front Command Dial to achieve exposure compensation of up to ±5-step while checking the results in your EVF in real time. This lets you capture perfectly exposed moments exactly as intended.Choice Of Six AF Modes To Suit Each Scene - The Fujifilm X100F offers AF-S for stationary subjects and AF-C for moving subjects. For both options, you can choose either Single Point AF, Zone AF or Wide / Tracking AF, in which the camera automatically selects multiple areas for focusing. In the Single Point AF and Zone AF modes, use the Focus Lever beside the LCD monitor to instantaneously change the location and size of focus areas.    Film Simulation Modes - A manufacturer of photographic film for over 80 years, Fujifilm has always been dedicated to achieving premium image quality across both analog and digital spectrums. The Fujifilm X100F features 15 Film Simulation options including PROVIA/Standard, Velvia/Vivid and ASTIA/Soft, which are named after Fujifilm's most renowned photographic films. They deliver warm skin tones, crisp blue hues of the sky and vivid green of lush greenery exactly as your mind remembers in your memory. This is the first X100 Series model to feature ACROS, delivering smooth gradation, deep blacks and beautiful textures that set it apart from the conventional Monochrome mode.    Ultra-Fast Electronic Shutter At 1/32000 Sec - Featuring a durable leaf shutter that withstands 100,000 actuations and an electronic shutter with silent operation, the Fujifilm X100F is a formidable photographic tool. When operating on electronic shutter, the camera delivers an ultra-high shutter speed of up to 1/32000 sec to achieve correct exposure even in strong daylight or when shooting with the aperture wide open. You can switch the shutter sound setting to Off in a quiet church or during a concert for total discretion.    Extended Full-HD Video Recording - Full HD video recording is supported in six frame rates (59.94p / 50p / 29.97p / 25p / 24p / 23.98p) with improved AF tracking performance as compared to previous models. You can adjust aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation settings while recording. Film Simulation effects can also be applied to video for versatile and artistic video output.Advanced Filters - Use this function to apply various filter effects to broaden your scope of artistic expressions. There are eight filters available, including High Key for reduced contrast and brighter tones overall, Toy Camera for a retro appearance, and Partial Color for retaining a specific color range and turning the rest into monochrome. You can check the filter effect in real time while shooting through your EVF and LCD.    Three-Stop Built-In ND Filter - The Fujifilm X100F's lens has a built-in ND filter, which is useful when shooting with the aperture wide open in bright light, or when opting to use a slow shutter speed. The three-stop ND filter, which cuts down the amount of light to 1/8, can be activated easily with the function button or from the camera menu.    Conversion Lenses - The WCL-X100 II Wide Conversion and the TCL-X100 II Teleconversion Lenses expand the Fujifilm X100F's shooting field while perfectly retaining the advanced image quality and performance of the camera's fixed Fujinon 23mmF2 Prime Lens. Their elegant design, created specifically for the X100 Series, is in total harmony with the Fujifilm X100F. These conversion lenses are optically designed to draw out the performance of Fujifilm X100F's lens to the maximum extent, delivering premium image quality without affecting the lens' f-stop value. The camera body automatically recognizes when a conversion lens is mounted and displays framing guidelines indicating the shooting area when in OVF mode.    Digital Teleconverter - Activate the Digital Teleconverter to achieve an angle of view equivalent to 50mm or 70mm in addition to the built-in 35mm perspective. This function is perfect for discreetly getting a little closer or to accentuate certain features in your frame. Using the EVF or LCD to check your image in real time allows you to maintain full concentration on your subject matter while shooting.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-050136x1500.jpg,,,,,,,

samys-293f6fa57b3b8d44de6ef5227c71429e,RM3DI Camera Body,USD,5599.00,Arca-Swiss,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The Arca-Swiss RM3DI Camera Body is the perfect tool for any photographer wishing to shoot both with a digital back as well as film. The ARCA Rm3Di can be mounted with lenses ranging from 23 mm to 210mm. Schneider, as well as Rodenstock are both working hard on the development of new lenses specifically designed for digital photography. During the development of Rm3Di, ARCA-SWISS's engineers decided to employ an integrated focusing system, in the body of the camera. They also integrated the tilt, or swing, mechanism into the body as well. Thus, there is no need to pay extra for the tilt/swing mechanism even for lenses as short as 23mm. The purchase price for the body includes these mechanisms as well as the grips, tripod mount, and ground lass. Furthermore, the helical mount of the ARCA SWISS Rm3Di is much more precise than traditional helical mounts as it’s movements utilize a far finer pitch than supplied with most lenses of this type. This focusing helical can rotate almost 5 times completely. Each lens is supplied with a focus card, which may be had as a PDF to be used in Phone/ipad etc., for convenience. The card shows the setting for all distances from nearest, depending on the lens to infinity. Each lens is mounted in a calibrated precision lens barrel. The lenses can then be either directly attached to ARCA SWISS's Rm3Di via the incorporated bayonet mount or -and this, once again, is unique -used by means of an optional bayonet lens board in Arca-Swiss bellows view type cameras. Lenses already owned by the customer, which are appropriate for the setup being purchased, may be precision mounted at Arca-Swiss for a small charge. An AIP, all-in-plane, rise/fall and shift capability has been integrated into all R camera bodies. This means that the perspective does not change, as the lens is not moving when these movements are utilized. Architectural, automotive and still life photographers, as well as, those making landscape photographs, are bound to be delighted with the ability to adjust image sharpness using the axis tilt/swing movement. This is done with a geared fine adjustment control located beneath the lens. The motion is self-locking and zeros in a detent at the 0 position. This does not result in any restriction of the field of view. The back features the standard 6x9 cm reversible focusing screen/fresnel of ARCA SWISS, model N. It permits the installation of all 6x9 system accessories, such as a binocular viewfinder or compendium, for instance. Any digital back mounted for Phase/Mamiya, Hasselblad V or H, Contax 645, or even Leaf AFI/Sinar HY6 can be accommodated with our adapter plates. A standard 6x9/6x7 roll back adapter is also offered. The backs/groundglass can also change orientation vis-a-vis use of either the rotational ‘Rotatmount’ or the ‘Rotaslide’ optional accessories. Just a twist and you have changed from Vertical to Horizontal. Much safer and quicker, and cuts down on dust as well. The RM3di does not require shimming for sharp pictures. It requires a test set of images with a subject perhaps 1/2 mile or 1000 meters distant, be made, and interpreted on the computer for best or sharpest image. Perhaps 6 or 10 images will suffice. This test will show you your focus factor. i.e.: If an image at focus mark 2 was the best, 2 is your focus factor So you add this number to the number indicated on the focus card for the distance to the focus point you have chosen and you will be sharp. This means that if you have 2 digital backs, you don’t have to have 2 bodies. Or if you need to rent or borrow another back, you won’t need to shim the body to the new back. Just do the quick test to determine the focus factor for the new body, and you are ready to shoot great images. Each back will have a different focus factor. Even 2 of the same type will be different. This test takes perhaps 20 minutes tops. An electronic rangefinder focusing module is also available. Called the emodule cloud, it allows the user to focus through its bright, multicoated lens. The distance is shown on the emodule screen at the rear. The user can then transfer this reading easily to through the rear facing readout. by matching the focused readout to the distance the camera is focused. Both distances are shown on the rear-facing screen. As the helical on the body is rotated the cameras focused distance is shown next to the object distance obtained by the emodule. Match them up and you will be sharp! Additionally, just below the distance indicator readout, there 4 rows of numbers. These represent the near plane and far plane distances for 4 apertures respectively: F5.6, F8, F11, F16. So you not only have the focus distance shown but the depth of field indicated as well. This is continuously variable as you change the distance you are focused at. The focal length and circle of confusion for the DOF calculations are user entered. No other camera made has this capability. A Variofinder accessary is available and is mounted in its accessory shoe, centered on the top of ARC SWISS Rm3Di. Thanks to its zooming capabilities, it covers all focal lengths in the range of 23 210mm with the corresponding masks, which are provided with each lens. With the aid of these masks, it is extremely easy to transfer the rise/fall or shift adjustment to the digital back or focusing screen. A small drum, also provided with each lens, integrated in the Variofinder, acts as a guide to the depth of field for the lens focal length and distance focused. The Variofinder can be attached to the camera in portrait or in landscape format. The ARCA-SWISS Rm3Di is built in such a way that it can be used as the front of an Arca-Swiss 6x9 camera or on the optical bench of every ARCA-SWISS camera, with the appropriate bellows. This enables use of its fine focus capabilities for focus stacking, for instance. Modular design par excellence! ARCA-SWISS Rm3D can be directly clamped onto an ARCA-SWISS Monoball or an ARCA-SWISS Cube with classic or fliplock type QR. The foot is designed, and now delivered with both classic and monoballfix type feet. There is a hole in the middle of this tripod mount to allow the passage of a cable release. Thus, the camera can be held with both hands during hand held shooting and can, for example, be triggered with the left thumb -going off without delay and staying resistant to shocks. It also doesn’t drop cable release when lenses are exchanged. Convenient!",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-025602x1000.jpg,,,,,,,

samys-318bd614e9a53533ee54e472db2bad12,EOS 6D Digital SLR Camera Body,USD,999.00,Canon,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The Canon EOS 6D Digital SLR Camera Body is a full-frame 20.2MP DSLR offering exceptionally high image quality and detail while providing compatibility and convenience through its design and features. When paired with the powerful DIGIC 5+ image processor and 14-bit A/D conversion, the full-frame sensor is capable of recording vivid imagery with expanded sensitivity up to ISO 102400. The processing power also affords intelligent noise reduction techniques and the ability to record continuous still images at a rate up to 4.5 full resolution fps.The Canon 6D employs an 11-point autofocus system for acquiring precise focus regardless of the shooting situation, which is further enhanced by a center cross-type focus point for improved low-light focus sensitivity. The iFCL 63-zone dual layer metering sensor also benefits from the autofocus system when making exposure measurements, and analyzes color and luminance values within the scene to determine accurate exposure settings.Full HD video recording is possible up to 1080/30p in the All I-frame or IPB compression, as well as the standard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec. When recording HD video, full manual control over exposure and sound is possible, enabling you to take complete control over the final appearance of your movies.Built-in Wi-Fi and GPS technologies also provide extensive connectivity to the Canon 6D. The built-in Wi-Fi capability allows you to take remote control over the 6D when used in conjunction with the Canon EOS Remote app (available for iOS and Android), as well as instantly share the images from your camera to your phone or to the CANON iMAGE GATEWAY. The GPS receiver will automatically record locational data and embed this information into the metadata of your images, allowing you to geotag your shots and map out where each shot was taken.The Canon 6D features a smaller form factor compared to other full-frame DSLRs, but still integrates a large 3.0"" 1,040K-dot TFT LCD monitor for clear playback and review of your imagery. The construction of the body integrates an aluminum alloy and polycarbonate chassis within a magnesium and polycarbonate shell for durability while still maintaining a lightweight profile.20.2 Megapixel Full-Frame CMOS Sensor, 14-Bit A/D Conversion, DIGIC 5+ Image ProcessorThe large full-frame 20.2 megapixel CMOS sensor offers a high level of image quality with attention given to sharpness, detail, and depiction of colors and tones within a scene. Due to increased information and detail, a larger sensor is capable of producing greater visual depth and smoother gradients and tonal transitions. Additionally, a large sensor provides more leeway to control the plane of focus and apply selective focus techniques.This sensor delivers images with a maximum resolution of 5472 x 3648 pixels, with a pixel size of 6.55 µm square, for greater reception of light and a lower signal-to-noise ratio. This pixel structure works in close collaboration with the DIGIC 5+ image processor, and its 14-bit A/D conversion, to produce a native sensitivity range of ISO 100-25600, which can be further expanded to ISO 50-102400.In addition to contributing to the low-light sensitivity, the DIGIC 5+ processor also delivers overall speed and power to the Canon 6D and utilizes dual 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits for expedited conversion of both JPEG and RAW file formats. This enables a maximum continuous shooting rate of 4.5 full resolution frames-per-second as well as greater noise reduction when working at higher ISOs. The DIGIC 5+ processor also provides real-time compensation for chromatic aberration when working with both still and moving imagery. Built-In Wi-Fi and GPSBuilt-in Wi-Fi and GPS  technologies enable highly functional connectivity with other devices,  including the ability to instantly share imagery from your camera and  geotag your photographs.Exposure settings can be controlled  remotely from your smartphone when using Canon's proprietary iOS and  Android app, Canon EOS Remote, allowing you to make exposures and modify  camera settings from a distance. You can also review imagery from your  camera on your smart device, and transfer files wirelessly. Full DNLA  (Digital Living Network Alliance) compatibility is supported, which  enables you to share your images from the Canon 6D with other household  products such as HDTVs, tablets, and other Wi-Fi-enabled Canon cameras.  You are also able to upload still images directly to CANON iMAGE  GATEWAY, allowing you to then easily share images with social networking  sites without the use of a computer.The GPS receiver functions  similarly and is able to record locational data (longitude, latitude,  altitude, and universal coordinated time) as EXIF data which is then  embed into your image files. This then permits you to track where your  images were recorded and view your exact route traveled.11-Point Autofocus SystemThe Canon 6D integrates an 11-point AF system for fast and precise focusing regardless of your subject matter or working situation. These 11 points provide even coverage across the entire frame while a more refined center cross-type point with EV -3 sensitivity provides more efficient, accurate low-light focusing. One-shot AF, AI Servo AF, and AI Focus AF are all available depending on one's needs, and furthermore the AI Servo mode is customizable in regard to focus tracking, acceleration, and deceleration sensitivities, as well as 1st or 2nd image priority adjustments. Lens data can also be entered and customized within the camera for greater focus refinement when working with wide-angle or telephoto lenses.Also contributing to sharp focus, the Canon 6D incorporates a large, bright pentaprism viewfinder with 21mm eye point and 97% frame coverage for clear viewing of the scene. This construction greatly benefits the manual focusing capabilities, as well as general low-light composition. iFCL 63-Zone Dual Layer Metering SensorAn intelligent metering system works in conjunction with the autofocus system and independently analyzes focus, color, and luminance within the scene for the most precise exposure settings possible. The 63 zones cover the entire image area with great detail and the dual-layer design permits a wider sensitivity to different wavelengths of light.The dual layers are split into a red/green channel and a blue/green channel; which counters the red light sensitivity bias electronic sensors inherently have. A series of algorithms are employed to combine data received from both layers, with the resulting exposure reading being extremely accurate regardless of the shooting conditions.This metering system employs evaluative, center-weighted, and spot metering methods to determine exposure, as well as allowing for a +/- 5 EV exposure compensation for greater manipulation of the determined exposure setting. EOS HD VideoFull HD video recording is supported in multiple formats, including 1080/30p, 24p, 25p; 720/60p, 50p; 480/60p, 50p. While recording video, a 4GB automatic file partition is employed in order to gain longer continuous recording times, up to 29 minutes 59 seconds. Both All I-frame (requires UHS-I memory card) and IPB compressions are supported as well as the standard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec. Embedding the time code is also possible for greater convenience when recording with multiple cameras.Video performance is further enhanced with the ability to manually adjust your exposure settings and audio levels; exposure can be adjusted using both aperture and shutter speed variables, and sound can be managed through a 64-level volume control. Additionally, an external stereo microphone can be used and is connected through the 3.5mm microphone terminal.The DIGIC 5+ processor also dramatically improves video response times and helps to reduce color artifacts, aberrations, and moiré while providing the ability to record with sensitivities up to ISO 25600 in H mode. Efficient DesignThe Canon 6D contains a large full-frame sensor within a compactly-sized body for greater portability without sacrificing image quality. The body features an aluminum alloy and polycarbonate chassis with a magnesium and polycarbonate exterior for durability. The shutter rated up to 100,000 cycles.Also contributing to the efficiency of design, an Integrated Cleaning System permits internal dust removal. To counter the effects of dust within the housing, the glass filter is cleaned through ultrasonic vibration and the dust particles are collected by an adsorbent. This unit is completely sealed from external contaminants, and the optical low-pass filter features an anti-dust fluorine coating for ease in removing more substantial dust particles. 3.0"" Clear View LCD MonitorThe 3.0"" Clear View TFT LCD provides high quality viewing with a 1,040,000-dot resolution and anti-reflection coating. This allows for sharp and clear viewing in even the brightest of conditions and displays images and videos with great detail and richness. The display also features a viewing angle up to 160° for review from the side or below.When used in conjunction with Live View mode, a smaller display is superimposed over the image. Live View mode permits real-time image review and can also place grid lines over the image for compositional help. A built-in electronic level is available for maintaining consistent horizons or for lining up parallel lines within a scene. You can also zoom into and navigate within the image when in Live View and use the grid lines for minute control and precision over the alignment of your photograph. Built-In HDR and Multiple Exposure ModesA High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is available and allows for the creation of HDR images in-camera, reducing the time needed to manually overlay images in post-production. When using this mode, a series of bracketed exposures are made of the same image, then automatically integrated into the same frame, resulting in a photograph without blown highlights or blocked up shadows and a long middle range of tones. This mode is especially useful when photographing scenes with a great deal of contrast.Multiple exposures are also possible in-camera and up to 9 exposures can be recorded onto a single file using 2 distinct settings for control. When in Additive mode, this closely resembles making multiple exposures on film and layers each exposure; manual exposure compensation is required. Average mode layers the images and automatically compensates for the final exposure, eliminating the unintended possibility of gross under or overexposure. Multiple exposures can be recorded in either JPEG or RAW formats, and furthermore you can utilize an existing RAW image as a starting point from which to layer subsequent images, which can then be manipulated in real time on the LCD. Scene Intelligent Auto and Special Scene modesScene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon's automatic exposure technology together in order to output a well-refined exposure. Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure are all employed to intelligently analyze the scene at hand and produce the most effective exposure settings to clearly render your subject matter.Special Scene modes also help to enhance your imagery by applying a system of corrections for use in more difficult lighting situations. Handheld Night Scene automatically captures four consecutive exposures, at shutter speeds fast enough to handhold, and layers them into a single frame. This allows you to effectively record images in darker situations without the need of a tripod or stabilization device. HDR Backlight Control works in the same manner and records a series of exposures at different values to ensure highlight and shadow values are not lost. These under and over-exposed images are blended to create a final image with a wider dynamic range.Other Features 

Compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC, including Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards.
Peripheral illumination, chromatic aberration, and distortion corrections are available and programmable through a menu of different available EF lenses. This lens data is used to automatically correct for each individual lens' traits to produce the cleanest image possible.
In-camera RAW processing and JPEG resizing are available to allow for expedited offloading of imagery that is instantly reading for the method in which you intend to share it.
Comparative playback allows you to view two images side-by-side in order to expedite editing procedures on the camera's LCD.
Silent shooting is a low-vibration shooting mode that slows and mutes the shutter and mirror reflex, enabling a more discrete method of capturing imagery.

It features the same Canon designed and manufactured 50.6 Megapixel sensor, with the low-pass filter (LPF) effect cancelled to provide even more fine edge sharpness and detail for critical subjects such as detailed landscapes, and other situations where getting the sharpest subject detail is a priority.FEATURES: 

Low-pass filter effect cancellation - For photographers wanting the ultimate in high resolution capture, the Canon EOS 5DS R camera has a low-pass filter* (LPF) effect cancellation. While a low-pass filter is useful to reduce color artifacts and moiré typical with digital capture, it also reduces detail at the pixel level. With the LPF disabled, the Canon EOS 5DS R takes full advantage of the original resolving power of the camera's 50.6 Megapixel sensor. More detail is captured and retained in the original image, perfect for landscape and commercial applications where pixel-level detail is scrutinized and when the sharpest possible image is needed. 
50.6 Megapixel Full-frame CMOS sensor - The Canon EOS 5DS R camera features Canon's newest full-frame CMOS sensor. At 50.6 Megapixels, it's the highest resolution sensor in the history of EOS. It captures 8712 x 5813 effective pixels, delivering images with an unprecedented level of realism perfect for large-scale commercial printing, fine art, significant crops and any number of other high-end applications. Thanks to this amazing sensor, engineered to work in concert with dual DIGIC 6 Image Processors, the Canon EOS 5DS R is a remarkable, high-resolution camera with impressive performance.
Fine Detail mode in Picture Style - Taking advantage of its sensor's high-resolution capturing power, the Canon EOS 5DS R camera has a new Picture Style called Fine Detail mode. Fine Detail emphasizes fine edges and patterns or textures by setting the camera's Sharpness sub-settings, fineness and threshold to their minimum and by lowering contrast settings as well. Prioritizing minute details in the image allows for better gradations, more detailed textures and fine edges for smoother, more polished photographs.
EOS Scene Detection System with RGB+IR Metering Sensor - The Canon EOS 5DS R camera has an amazing iSA Intelligent Scene Analysis system that employs an independent RGB+IR light sensor with approximately 150,000-pixel resolution. This sensor enables Canon's Intelligent Tracking and Recognition system (iTR AF) that detects and tracks subjects, automatically switching the AF point to optimize tracking. With new tracking algorithms tailored to recognize faces and colors, this system serves as a brilliant foundation to the Canon EOS 5DS R's AF system.
61-point High Density Reticular AF - For fast, precise AF with sophisticated tracking performance, the EOS 5DS R camera has an advanced, 61-point High Density Reticular AF system with up to 41 cross-type AF points. The Canon EOS 5DS R's AF system is incredibly sensitive to changes in composition, making adjustments quickly to help ensure consistent, sharp AF. A new RGB+IR AF (with approximately 150,000 pixels) sensor monitors subject motion, and Canon's iTR Intelligent Tracking and Recognition system synchronizes the active AF point with the subject's motion, helping to ensure that AF precision is maintained. With focus modes dedicated to the particulars of the shooting environment, the Canon EOS 5DS R realizes a level of focus accuracy befitting its 50.6 Megapixel sensor.
Advanced Mirror control mechanism and shutter release time lag - The camera shake that occurs from the impact of an SLR's mirror can leave blurred details in the recorded image. This effect is magnified when working with a super high-resolution sensor like the one found in the Canon EOS 5DS R camera. To counter the effects of conventional, spring-driven SLR mirrors, the Canon EOS 5DS R features a newly developed Mirror Vibration Control system. The camera's mirror is not controlled by springs but instead is driven by a small motor and cams. This system suppresses the impact typical of the camera's mirror, significantly reducing impact and its effects on the image. A new Time Release Lag setting, easily accessed on the Canon EOS 5DS R's menu system, offers added protection against camera shake by setting the shutter release time intentionally longer so the camera does not begin the exposure until after the impact of the camera's mirror has diffused.
Anti-flicker feature - With Canon's Anti-flicker function, the Canon EOS 5DS R camera is able to deliver accurate results under cycling lighting situations. Under flickering light, such as fluorescent lighting, a fast shutter speed may result in an irregular exposure. The Canon EOS 5DS R's Anti-flicker function detects the frequency and phase of the flicker and captures images near the point of peak brightness when the subject is most likely well illuminated.
Built-in intervalometer and bulb timer - The Canon EOS 5DS R camera offers time-lapse fixed-point shooting and long exposures without the need for a remote control. The Canon EOS 5DS R's interval timer takes from 1 to 99 shots at preselected intervals (from 1 second to 99 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds, or unlimited), ideal for shooting flowers as they bloom or clouds drifting through the sky. Captured exposures can even be collected and saved as an HD movie. Its built-in bulb timer keeps the shutter open for a designated amount of time, perfect for night photography, to capture the flow of traffic on a street corner, or any other situation where long exposure photography is warranted.
1.3x and 1.6x crop shooting - For still photography, the Canon EOS 5DS R camera features the flexibility of a cropping feature that extends the shooting effect 1.3x and 1.6x. With 50.6 Megapixel capture, cropped shots are possible with plenty of resolution to spare. Images recorded at 1.3x (APS-H) are approximately 30.5 Megapixels (6768 x 4512) Large/Fine JPEG, while images recorded at 1.6x (APS-C) are approximately 19.6 Megapixels (5424 x 3616) Large/Fine JPEG. Particularly useful in extending the range of telephoto lenses, the crop function also improves the Canon EOS 5DS R's subject tracking capability with almost the entire frame covered with AF points. Image cropping can be displayed in the viewfinder either masked or overlaid with an outline showing the cropped area, and in Live View shooting the image is cropped by the effect chosen. Aspect ratios can also be defined, with the Canon EOS 5DS R shooting in 1:1, 4:3, and 16:9 ratios, in addition to the default 3:2.
Intelligent Viewfinder II - The Canon EOS 5DS R camera's Intelligent Viewfinder II makes it easy to both shoot, change and confirm camera settings and shooting modes all without looking away from the viewfinder. Displaying approximately 100% of the composition, the viewfinder can show settings like shooting mode, exposure level, white balance, drive mode, AF operation, metering mode, recording format, an electronic level and more. All of this information can be displayed by or superimposed easily over the image for review while shooting, and multiple views are customizable through the Canon EOS 5DS R's simple user interface.

A concept that has been epitomised by Leica since Oskar Barnack laid the foundations for 35 mm photography more than a hundred years ago, with the original Leica. This concept has been central to our company’s philosophy - based on the art of engineering on one hand, and on visionary risk-taking on the other. A philosophy that leads to innovation, rewriting photographic history again and again. As it has with the new Leica Q, a camera which continues this groundbreaking Leica tradition with a full-frame sensor and a fixed-focus lens.Whether your subject involves depth of field, an available-light situation or a macro photography shot, the Summilux 28mm f/1.7 ASPH. provides everything you need to express yourself photographically. Its classic 28mm focal length is perfect for street, architectural and landscape photography. Its lens, the fastest in its class, combined with a specially designed 24 MP CMOS full-frame sensor, provides detailed images of unsurpassed quality: up to ISO 50,000.The integrated viewfinder of the Leica Q is activated as soon as the camera is brought up to the eye. It faithfully displays the camera’s image at any time, right down to the smallest detail and without any perceptible delay. With its resolution of 3.68 MP, it surpasses all other electronic viewfinders. The autofocus is also outstanding, capturing with ultimate sharpness at maximum speed. The new Maestro II series processor works extremely rapidly and allows a serial image speed of up to 10 frames per second at full resolution. And of course, the images are instantly available as a JPEG in playback mode.Intuitive, ergonomic, pragmatic. The controls of the Leica Q provide quick access to all relevant options and opportunities. For example, auto-focus can be set either using buttons or via the touch screen. Prefer to focus manually?  Then let the innovative Live View aids “Focus-Peaking” and “Live View Zoom” assist you. Easy to use, the Leica Q helps you implement your ideas perfectly - at the press of a button.The built-in Wi-Fi module on the Leica Q makes it easy to share your pictures and videos on social networks. Images can be downloaded to your smartphone, tablet or computer via WLAN and the complimentary Leica Q app. The app also allows the Leica Q to be operated remotely. For example, set the time and aperture on your device and use it as a remote-control release. In this way, blur-free long exposures and recordings are possible from unusual angles – and also as moving images. What’s more, you can record video in Full-HD and web-friendly MP4.The Leica maxim 'focusing on the essentials' also applies to the Leica Q’s exterior design. Made in Germany, the high quality materials and outstanding craftmanship guarantee maximum durability. The top cover is milled from a solid aluminium block, while the housing is finished in magnesium and all labels and markings on the adjustment wheels are laser engraved. The thumb rest on the back of the camera and the diamond pattern of the exterior finish make the Leica Q beautifully easy to grip.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-039182x750.jpg,,,,,,,

That means the Nikon D610 is both slimmer than a traditional HDSLR and more budget-friendly. And with a full-sized sensor also comes a powerful engine; the EXPEED 3 processing system enables features such as 6 fps continuous shooting at full resolution. Also, compact as it may be, the Nikon D610 still fits in a 3.2"" LCD monitor.Features

The Nikon D610 also has other hardy features that allow the camera to stretch for the photographer's needs. Such features include a wide ISO range of 100-6400, which is also expandable to 50-25600. This allows shots to be captured in a variety of lighting situations, from low-light to bright, with minimal image noise. The camera also has 39 focus points for wide-area AF coverage for both stills and HD video capture.Other ways that the Nikon D610 enables the photographer to focus on the job at hand include features like Nikon's well-known metering and onboard intelligence. The camera uses the company's intelligent Scene Recognition System with 3D Color Matrix Metering II for beautiful, high-def images. This metering takes into account brightness, contrast, subject distance, and the scene colors for accurate, balanced photos. The i-TTL flash, auto white balance, subject tracking, and autofocus all come into play as well.The D610 is an HDSLR, featuring 1080p HD video capture. Selectable frame rates include 30/25/24p at the highest resolution and 30/25/24p at 720p. Other useful features at the photographer's disposal for shooting movies include manual exposure control, full-time AF with face-priority, dedicated inputs for a stereo mic and headphones, Simultaneous Live View, and then some.The Nikon D610 is compatible with F-mount NIKKOR interchangeable lenses (both FX and DX-format), giving the photographer a wealth of options. Additionally, the camera can be used with Nikon's WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter for wireless transfer of images to a smartphone or tablet. The adapter can even be used for remotely capturing images with the D610 using the compatible app.Compact Full-Frame HDSLRFull-frame, high-resolution performance is available in a compact, affordable HDSLR - the Nikon D610. The camera's 24.3MP FX-format CMOS sensor captures every detail with lifelike sharpness. Its EXPEED 3 processing system manages all that data with speed and accuracy, enabling up to 6 frames-per-second (fps) continuous shooting at full resolution. The camera also features a fast power-up (0.13 seconds) and minimal shutter release lag (0.052 seconds). And the low-light performance synonymous with Nikon is again proven deserved-shoot crystal clear images from ISO 100 to 6400, expandable down to 50 and up to 25,600 for extreme situations. Highly Accurate AF System for Superior SharpnessThe Nikon D610 has 39 focus points that provide wide-area AF coverage and offer seemingly endless compositional possibilities. The 9 cross-type sensors and 7 center focus points work all the way down to f/8.0 for extended AF functionality with teleconverters and long-reach lenses. When shooting photos or HD video in Live View, Nikon's responsive contrast-detect AF activates for accurate full time auto focusing.Metering and Onboard IntelligenceThe Nikon D610 delivers consistently beautiful still images and HD videos, thanks to Nikon's intelligent Scene Recognition System with 3D Color Matrix Metering II. Its 2,016 pixel RGB sensor evaluates every scene, taking into account brightness, contrast, subject distance and the scene colors, all within the time it takes to press the shutter release button. That data is then referenced against an onboard image database for consistently accurate exposures, auto white balance, i-TTL flash and subject-tracking autofocus performance.Cinema-Quality HD Video ProjectsShoot 1080p HD videos with selectable frame rates of 30p, 25p or 24p and MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 compression. Bend time with 720p HD at 60p, 50p or 30p for ultra-smooth video playback of fast moving subjects, or create slow-motion footage during post processing. Maintain your creative vision with manual exposure control, full-time AF with face-priority and subject tracking, dedicated inputs for a stereo mic and headphones, still image exporting, and much more. Enhance all that with the dramatic perspectives and depth-of-field control of NIKKOR interchangeable lenses.Built-In Accessory TerminalOn the opposite side of the camera's dual memory card bays you'll find the various sockets and ports including everything from audio jacks to USB. Under the flap designated ""GPS"" is the same accessory port used for both the GP-1A GPS Unit and MC-DC2 Remote Release Cord (both sold separately). While there is no 10-pin terminal, the MC-DC2 enables remote firing of select D-SLRs, including this D610, so you won't bump or vibrate the camera when taking photos. The GP-1A geotags your images so you can record latitude, longitude, altitude and time information. Allowing you to plot your images on map software and retrace your steps. Share Images Easily with the WU-1b Wireless Mobile AdapterUsing the optional WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter, users can automatically send great pictures to their smartphone or tablet and even remotely capture images from the Nikon D610. With its simple app, now when you can't wait to share that great image, you don't have to. Share it to your smartphone or tablet in an instant.Lighting Studio OptionalThe D610’s built-in pop-up flash offers up new shooting possibilities that other cameras simply can't match—and not just in low-light situations. Even well lit subjects can benefit from a balanced fill flash for extra depth and dimension. And since the D610’s flash integrates with Nikon’s i-TTL system, it can act as a Commander and communicate crucial exposure information to two groups of remote flashes across three channels for accurate lighting and exceptional results. When you need the extra power, add an optional accessory Nikon Speedlight for more lighting possibilities.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-028349x1200.jpg,,,,,,,

For photography in  the glare of bright sunlight, recording HD Video in an auditorium and  other situations where the lighting is difficult or using the LCD  monitor is inconvenient, the PowerShot G5 X’s electronic viewfinder  helps enable unfettered operation. Full control is made simple with  dedicated dials situated around the camera that let you easily customize  and control the settings. What’s more, helpful features like a built-in  accessory hot shoe and a multi-angle, capacitive touch screen monitor  serve to create an experience as unique as the subject being recorded.  With its phenomenal and large imaging sensor, its marvelous electronic  viewfinder and comprehensive operation, the PowerShot G5 X can deliver  performance that’s easy to see.FEATURES: 

1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor - At the heart of the PowerShot G5 X camera is a brilliant 1.0-inch 20.2 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor. Physically larger than the sensors found in most compact cameras, the PowerShot G5 X's sensor works in tandem with Canon's DIGIC 6 Image Processor to quickly deliver gorgeous, high-resolution images with nuanced details, plus impressive low-light performance with a low signal-to-noise ratio and minimal noise and distortion. Suitable for tremendous enlargements, significant cropping and many other applications appealing to the advanced photographer, images and video captured on the PowerShot G5 X's sensor are engineered to impress even the most critical eye.
Canon DIGIC 6 Image Processor - The PowerShot G5 X camera is powered by the latest iteration of Canon's proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which takes still and video image quality to a beautiful level. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot G5 X, powering full-resolution, high-speed continuous still shooting (even in P, Av, Tv and M modes) and the advanced star shooting modes. The processor allows for MP4 video recording for better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. The processor also supports an MF Peaking function, giving you a pro-level focusing tool.
Canon HS SYSTEM - The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G5 X camera: the large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more light; and the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with exceptional clarity and detail.
4.2x, f/1.8–2.8 Optical Zoom Lens (24–100mm) - To take advantage of its large, 1.0-inch imaging sensor, the PowerShot G5 X camera has a sharp and versatile 4.2x Optical Zoom lens. With a 35mm equivalent range of 24–100mm it's equally suitable for landscapes, portraits, group photographs and even close-up photography. Designed to perform in numerous lighting situations, the PowerShot G5 X's lens has a bright maximum aperture of f/1.8 for low light performance, a 9-blade aperture for beautiful, blurred background detail and is engineered to focus from distances as close as 2.0 in. The PowerShot G5 X's lens works in concert with the camera's sensor and image processor to reliably deliver sharp images from edge to edge and from wide-angle to telephoto, all tailored to meet the exacting standards of even critical photographers.
Intelligent IS - Equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS, the PowerShot G5 X camera helps you capture clear, steady images – even in low light without using a tripod. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.
Built-in 2.36 Million Dot, High-Definition Electronic Viewfinder - The PowerShot G5 X camera's defining feature is its unique, high-definition electronic viewfinder. It's great for photographers who prefer to hold the camera up to their eye, and is a veritable lifesaver in bright light and when composing on the camera's LCD screen is inconvenient or overly conspicuous. Featuring 2.36 million dots, and with a wide color gamut, it provides a high-contrast, realistic and smooth edge-to-edge view for image composition, adjustment and review. Designed for sustained use, it delivers 100% image coverage, a smooth refresh rate up to 120 frames-per-second (Smooth Mode) and a flexible information display that can enable comfortable camera operation throughout the day. Its 22mm eyepoint delivers excellent visibility, even when wearing glasses, and a built-in eye sensor helps the PowerShot G5 X to transfer quickly between the viewfinder display and Live View on the camera's LCD.
Convenient Controls Help Provide for Quick Control of Shooting Settings - Designed for speedy operation while looking through the viewfinder, the PowerShot G5 X features a host of controls for quick, accurate settings and adjustments. Beyond its Vari-angle touch panel LCD monitor, the PowerShot G5 X camera features a front dial situated on the front of the camera for operation with the index finger, a top-mounted, thumb-operated exposure compensation dial, a rear-mounted control dial plus a control ring around the camera's lens. Eminently customizable, each dial has an optimized operating torque that helps to identify it by feel, for sustained, intuitive and near-silent operation in quiet situations like weddings and performances.
Built-in Hot Shoe - The PowerShot G5 X camera's hot shoe enables expanded operations for advanced photography. It's compatible with all Speedlite flashes for the EOS System, so bounce flash and multiple-flash photography is easy to achieve. Whether attaching a Speedlite flash or the Remote Switch RS-60E3 for long exposures or night scenes, the PowerShot G5 X's hot shoe can help provide shooting opportunities far beyond the scope of most compact cameras.
High-resolution Multi-angle Touch Panel LCD - For composing photos and movies from any angle and for easy self-portraits, the PowerShot G5 X camera features a high-resolution, Vari-angle, capacitive LCD screen that can not only tilt out and rotate up to 270°, but can also be turned around and closed when using the camera's electronic viewfinder or when the camera is not in use. Its touch-panel operation makes it simple to access quick control settings, focus and shutter release right on the screen. 
1080p Full HD and Expanded Movie Options - With its large sensor and high performance lens the PowerShot G5 X camera creates spectacular 1080p Full HD video, but this premium model takes video-making even further with several high-end features. Set video capture to your shooting needs: 24p, 30p or 60p, with MP4 format available for easy sharing. Advanced audio includes expanded dynamic range and a better S/N ratio. Improved Dynamic IS significantly reduces shaking caused by handheld shooting. Manual controls (Av, Tv and ISO) can be set prior to and during shooting for full creative expression, and Manual Focus is also available. Shooting to commercial specifications is now possible with HDMI Live Out for checking images on an external monitor and an advanced tripod socket for smooth panning and tilting.
Built-in Wi-Fi Makes Sharing Quick and Easy - Built-in Wi-Fi technology is included for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends, family and the whole world. Easily post your images to social networking and media sites – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and Google Drive – through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY directly from your PowerShot camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both iOS and Android devices, and upload images via the free Canon Camera Connect app without a computer.

Wi-Fi technology also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer.
Built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) - PowerShot digital cameras with built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) technology eliminates the need to manually find and open the Canon Camera Connect app on your mobile device. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android device, and the Camera Connect app will launch automatically for quick, easy sharing of your images.

Now, NFC helps ensure a seamless connection to a compatible Android device. Simply touch the camera against an NFC-equipped device with the Canon Camera Connect app installed, and the Wi-Fi connection is established – no camera operations required. Even if your camera is off, NFC turns the camera on and establishes the connection (confirming the camera's nickname and privacy settings before the first connection is required).
Remote Shooting with the Camera Connect App - Remote shooting functions of the PowerShot G5 X camera through your smartphone or tablet have been vastly improved with the Canon Camera Connect app. Now a variety of the camera's expressive capabilities are available to you: use different shooting modes (P, Av, Tv, M, Custom); enjoy multi-aspect shooting and display; choose AF frame modes (single-point/face detection); shoot in continuous shooting mode; and utilize the AF button. In addition, the Camera Connect app is now universal to PowerShot and EOS cameras with built-in Wi-Fi, so if you switch between cameras, operation is easy and familiar.
Mobile Device Connect Button - The camera's dedicated Mobile Device Connect Button gives you one-touch access to your compatible mobile device or computer (utilizing Image Sync function). You can transfer photos and videos to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing to a computer on the same network. When the camera finds a linked computer on the same wireless network, images are sent directly to it. Otherwise, images are temporarily stored on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY then transferred once a connection is made – very convenient when you're on vacation or out for the day.
Image Sync Function - The Image Sync Function has been improved and expanded. In addition to wirelessly transferring photos and videos through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY to your computer, now you can view and download them from your smartphone. Take them anywhere, anytime, and use your familiar smartphone operations to view and share them.
Compatibility with Canon Connect Station CS100 - The PowerShot G5 X camera is fully compatible with Canon's photo and video storage device: Connect Station CS100. By simply tapping with NFC, photos and videos are wirelessly transferred to the Connect Station, where up to 1 TB of hard drive space and simple menus make them easy to store, manage and sort by albums, date or device name. From there, images and videos can be viewed in Full HD on an HDTV (via an HDMI cable), sent to compatible wireless printers, viewed/uploaded/downloaded from smartphones and tablets or PCs, and shared with other Canon Connect Stations and on social networking sites.
Star Shooting Mode - Starry skies were formerly out of reach to all but experienced SLR camera users, but the star shooting modes on the PowerShot G5 X camera make these wonderfully impressive images accessible to all. With just a tripod and simple settings, you can capture exquisite Star Nightscapes, Star Trails and Star Time-Lapse Movies. The modes can be performed fully automatically or with manual controls for extra versatility.

Its highly random pixel array effectively   reduces moiré and false colors without the use of an optical low-pass   filter. When combined with an XF lens, the sensor delivers images with a   perceived resolution far greater than the number of pixels used. Other   features include outstanding read speed, high-speed continuous  shooting,  high-precision AF tracking, highly faster liveview refresh  rate and  superb video recording.Excellent image processing from X-Processor Pro - The X-Processor Pro image processing engine is approximately four times   faster than the previous model. The increased built-in memory and   enhanced computational power bring out the maximum capabilities of the   X-Trans CMOS III sensor. It produces high quality images and improves   response times for shorter delays between shots, reduced shutter-release   time lag and greater AF precision. The engine also delivers faster  Live  View refresh rates and reduces image delay when tracking moving   subjects.Larger high-speed and high-precision phase detection AF area coupled with performance improvements - AF performance has been improved in a number of keys areas. The fast   and accurate phase detection AF now covers a larger part of the frame   and has been optimized in the area where users are most likely to   position the main subject. At the same time, the FUJIFILM X-T2 boasts   significant focusing improvements on small highlights, low contrast   subjects and subjects with fine textures, which have previously caused   problems for focal plane phase detection AF. Contrast detection AF,   which excels in low light conditions, has also received a performance   boost, with the ability to accurately focus in light levels as low as   -3EV. The camera also refocuses more regularly during the slow burst   mode in AF-C.Eye Detection AF automatically detects human eyes - Choose   Face Detection to automatically detect human faces, or turn on Eye   Detection AF to automatically detect and accurately focus on human eyes   for successful portraits with a shallow depth of field. You can also   define the area of priority focus, for example right or left eye, or the   eye closer to the camera. These functions have been upgraded for   improved accuracy to a level that will impress professional   photographers. They are particularly effective when shooting with the   XF56mmF1.2 R / XF56mmF1.2 R APD or XF90mmF2 R LM WR lenses.Pinpoint accurate focusing in MF mode - The FUJIFILM X-T2 has a variety of functions that assist pinpoint   focusing in the MF mode. Set the Focus Mode Lever to MF and rotate the   focus ring to access a variety of MF Assist functions. These include   Focus Peaking, in which color is used to show the parts of the image   that are in focus, and Digital Split Image, where focus is achieved by   lining up the split image strips in the center. These features are   particularly useful in macro photography and portraiture, which involve a   shallow depth of field and require focusing precision.Focus Lever to instantly change the focusing point - The focus area can be changed in eight directions using the FUJIFILM   X-T2's Focus Lever: up/down, right/left and diagonally. This allows   users to make quick changes to the focus area for accurate focusing   after composing an image. This feature is useful not only to shift the   AF points during autofocusing, but also to quickly choose the area to be   enlarged in MF Assist mode during manual focusing.Three parameters controlling AF-C - Fujifilm has substantially improved the AF-C algorithm to boost the   accuracy of the FUJIFILM X-T2's ability to track moving subjects. You   can now fine tune how the camera reacts to the way the subject moves   within the frame, how fast the subject moves and where in the frame the   camera prioritizes focus. The five presets in the AF-C Custom Settings   represent combinations of these three factors.AF-C Custom Settings - The AF-C Custom Setting allows you to select one of five AF presets   according to the subject's movements to obtain perfect focus tracking.   Based on how the subject moves, you can select a preset from, for   example, Preset 2: Ignoring obstacles, Preset 3: For subjects that   accelerate / decelerate, Preset 4: For subjects that suddenly come into   the frame or Preset 5: Subjects with erratic movements to obtain  optimum  settings for accurate subject tracking. A combination of three  factors:  Tracking sensitivity, Speed tracking sensitivity and Zone area   switching, may be manually set and registered as Preset 6: Custom.High-resolution Real Time Viewfinder with a 0.77x magnification ratio - The 2.36-million-dot high-resolution organic EL electronic viewfinder   has a magnification ratio of 0.77x, a horizontal viewing angle of 31   degrees, and a display time lag of just 0.005 seconds. The viewfinder,   which is 2 times brighter than the previous model, also features an   automatic brightness adjustment function so it's easy to see in all   conditions - even intense backlighting. It completely eliminates moiré   or false colors, and boasts performance comparable to an optical   viewfinder, but with the added advantage of displaying a live view that   reflects exposure settings.Up to 100 fps EVF refresh rate for a clear display even in low light - As standard, the EVF refreshes at a rate of 60 fps, but in Boost mode   this jumps to 100fps, which continuously displays even fast-moving   subjects smoothly to deliver a performance comparable to that of an   optical viewfinder. The fast refresh rate is maintained even in low   light for easy framing during night shooting.Focusing on subjects with erratic movements - Continuous   shooting performance has also been improved, enabling up to 11fps when   using the mechanical shutter* and 5fps in the Live View mode. The   viewfinder blackout time is now less than half that of the previous   model. This means that you can track a fast-moving subject more easily   for an extended period of time during continuous shooting. The   combination of advanced continuous shooting options and EVF performance   deliver continuous AF-C shooting never previously thought possible with   mirrorless cameras.Film Simulation on video recording - Film Simulation modes are available during video recording. Movie   shooters can enjoy extra creativity, without the need for lengthy   post-production, including monochrome video in ACROS and   documentary-themed tones in CLASSIC CHROME. You can also change settings   such as aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation while   recording video.Simultaneous HDMI output to an external monitor - Video can be output via HDMI during recording, allowing you to   simultaneously check footage on the camera's LCD monitor or EVF and an   external monitor. The data can even be recorded onto an external   recorder as you film in the uncompressed format. As for 4K movie, you   can choose log gamma ""F-Log"" to record a wider dynamic range than normal   video mode.Solid body with resistance to dust, moisture and low temperatures - The   FUJIFILM X-T2's body is made of magnesium alloy. Despite being compact   and lightweight, it is both solid and highly durable. The body is also   weather-sealed in 63 points to achieve a high level of resistance to   dust and moisture. Couple this with its ability to work in temperatures   down to -10°C and you'll see the camera is ready for anything. Similar   weather-sealing is applied to the dust-resistant and water-resistant   lenses and the Power Booster Grip to provide weather resistance across   the entire system.Exceptionally balanced for a comfortable and reliable grip - The FUJIFILM X-T1's grip has been further developed and now offers even   greater comfort on the FUJIFILM X-T2 thanks to a larger area set aside   as a thumb rest. Locking mechanisms have also been introduced for the  SD  Card Cover and Battery Cover.Three-direction tilting LCD screen - The   FUJIFILM X-T2 features a premium LCD screen that can tilt in three   directions. Tilt it up and down when shooting in landscape, and upward   when shooting in portrait. The screen remains positioned on the optical   axis of the lens for easier high-angle and low-angle shooting. The   3-inch LCD has 1.04 million dots and uses toughened glass. When not   tilted, it fits flush to the body.Lockable dials deliver quick and simple handling - Key exposure controls are dial-based, such as setting the shutter   speed, ISO sensitivity, exposure compensation, Drive Mode and Metering   Mode. This means settings can easily be changed, even when the camera is   turned off. Selected controls also feature lock and release buttons to   enhance overall operation.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-049985x1500.jpg,,,,,,,

samys-4b69630621d7a4b9eb20695e2a1548a9,"Fisheye No. 2, 35mm Camera",USD,49.99,Lomography,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The world's greatest compact Fisheye camera is now more amazing than you ever thought possible! Not only does it have same 180-degree wide-angle view and stunning fisheye barrel distortion, but the Fisheye No. 2 adds a bulb setting for long exposures, a switch for multiple exposures on the same frame, the ability to fire both a hotshoe flash and the built-in flash, a true fisheye viewfinder, and a ""full metal jacket"" body treatment. With this new arsenal, the possibilities for your Fisheye lomography are endless! Uses normal 35mm film that can be developed anywhere.





FEATURES



""B"" (Bulb) setting

By holding down the shutter button with your finger, you can keep the shutter open for as long as you like - thereby inviting all the gorgeous ambient light outside to come on in. To close the shutter, merely release the button.



""LNB"" variable exposure switch

Use this to control your Fisheye 2's shutter timing. ""L"" locks the shutter so it can't accidentally fire. ""N"" shoots a normal, instant exposure (1/100 sec, f/8). ""B"" or ""bulb"" selects Fisheye 2's long exposure capabilities - as detailed above.



Standard Flash Hotshoe & Built-In Electronic Flash

Use this to sync a Lomographic Colorsplash Flash or any other manual hotshoe flash to your Fisheye 2. The flash will fire when you hit the shutter release. You can also use the internal (built-in) flash as well. When using the ""N"" setting, both the internal and hotshoe flash will fire when you hit the shutter button (first curtain). If you select ""B"", then the hotshoe flash will fire when you first depress the button (first curtain), and the internal flash will fire when you let go of the button (second curtain).



Multiple Exposure Switch (MX)

This allows you to take two or more shots on the same frame. Take your first shot, press the MX button, and you're now ready for the next one. Repeat as many times as you like.



Accessory Viewfinder

Just slip this little jewel into the hotshoe and you'll get an authentic preview of the fisheye treat waiting for you to capture it.



Full Metal Jacket

If those rowdy bikers are giving you a hard time, then just show 'em the Fisheye 2's new hard-as-nails metal-plated exterior. Built for toughness, but refined for beauty - you'll feel equally comfortable slinging your camera at a Texas Hog Pit or a Parisian Debutante Ball.



170-degree field of view

The heart, soul, and blood of the Fisheye's brilliance: an enormous field of view that takes in literally half of the world around you and compacts it into a nice and tight circular image. Barrel distortions twist and bend your subjects around the edges, stretch them towards and away from your lens, and converge their lines towards the center.



Extreme close-up potential

Not an exercise for the timid - the Fisheye lavishly rewards those who bravely advance within a whisper of their subject. Get right up to their face, and watch their nose get sucked into your lens while their ears and forehead s-l-i-d-e-s backwards. Sharp, beautiful pictures are possible from even the closest quarters. Party on.



Huge depth of field

Super-wide-angle images like the ones spat out by the Fisheye come with a wonderful bonus: focused sharpness from the front to the rear of your image. Each fisheye image shows massive depth of field, so your subject and background will be nice and crispy clear.



Premium optics

Sitting inside that massive snout are several of the loveliest optical lens elements that you have ever seen. They work together in perfect harmony to give you bright colors, punchy contrast, super-blue skies, ultra-red lips, and yellow bananas like you have never seen before.



Normal 35mm Film & Normal Development

That's right. Both the Fisheye and Fisheye No. 2 take normal 35mm film that any juke-joint lab, drugstore, or supermarket can easily process without a second thought.



One Year Warranty

The Lomographic Society International guarantees your camera against any manufacturer-related defects for one full year after your receive it.

Full-pixel readout without pixel binning for high-resolution 4K movies makes it possible to deliver detail-rich full-frame movies via the oversampling effect achieved by condensing approximately 2.4 times the amount of data required for 4K (6K equivalent) for 4K output (QFHD: 3840 x 2160). Furthermore, the high speed of the newly developed image sensor reduces the rolling shutter effect.Improved Fast Hybrid AF for movie shooting - Keep images sharp and clear in shooting 4K movies. Fast Hybrid AF for movie recording has evolved and its AF area has been extended to nearly the same width as that for stills, enabling high-speed high-precision AF throughout the frame. Also, further reduction of speed at the “low” end of AF speed enables more pronounced slow focus effects.XAVC S for high-bitrate recording - XAVC S format is used for 4K and HD recording. High bitrates of up to 100Mbps for 4K 30p (25p)/24p recording, and up to 50Mbps for full-HD 60p (50p)/30p (25p)/24p recording, ensure beautifully detailed movies with minimal compression noise. Since 100Mbps recording is possible even at the highest 120fps in full-HD, high-quality slow-motion sequences can be created during post processing.Zebra functions - Simplify exposure with Zebra. Target video brightness from 0-109%, set +10% and -10% range, check zebra pattern for areas in range, and see minimum brightness to avoid blown-out highlights.Slow and Quick motion - Vary the pace of movie footage to enhance viewing interest and enjoyment. Instantly selectable via a dial, “S&Q” mode supports slow and quick motion, with frame rates from 1fps to 120fps (100fps) selectable in eight steps for up to 60x (50x) quick motion and 5x (4x) slow motion, recordable at Full HD (50Mbps) quality. You can “play with time” by compressing movement or extending a moment, and then accent ordinary footage with these interludes to add comic or dramatic emphasis.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-051608x1500.jpg,,,,,,,

With a compact, rugged design that's  easy to carry, this premium camera gives you inspirational image quality  through its 1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor,  plus the power to zoom to an incredible 25x. You'll be able to capture  what you see wherever life takes you: broad, majestic landscapes,  virtually blur-free low-light images, and beautifully detailed wildlife.  You can also capture action as it happens in beautiful 1080p Full HD  video, and share your images/videos with easy Wi-Fi connectivity, which  now includes built-in NFC for touch communication with a compatible  Android device. Whether you're traveling around the world or  enjoying your favorite outdoor activities close to home, you'll want to  pack the PowerShot G3 X camera.FEATURES: 

1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor - The PowerShot G3 X camera's 1.0-inch sensor achieves a beautiful balance between high sensitivity and high image quality. The sensor is able to collect more light in a shorter time period without the overflow that causes blown-out highlights. This means better detail and sophisticated tonal quality, with rich gradations even at high ISO speeds all the way to 12800. A high signal-to-noise ratio delivers minimal noise and distortion with breathtaking dynamic range, particularly notable in bright areas. And photography enthusiasts will appreciate the changes in image processing for the PowerShot G3 X, which include target exposure value and contrast characteristics of highlights. Thanks to this change, dynamic range in bright areas is expanded with gradation attributes that are similar to EOS. Also, by changing the exposure index standard, it is possible to shoot at almost the same brightness with the same aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings as EOS. The PowerShot G3 X natively captures images in the 3:2 aspect ratio, which is the same as Canon EOS SLR cameras. The camera's image creation technology was designed with post processing in mind, and features an Aspect Ratio function, enabling RAW image capture in 16:9, 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1 aspect ratios while maintaining the same angle of view.
Canon DIGIC 6 Image Processor - The PowerShot G3 X camera is powered by the latest iteration of Canon's proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which takes still and video image quality to a beautiful new level. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot G3 X, powering full resolution high-speed continuous still shooting (even in P, Av, Tv and M modes) and the advanced star shooting modes. The processor allows for MP4 video recording for better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. The new processor also supports an MF Peaking function, giving you a pro-level focusing tool.
Canon HS SYSTEM - The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen, whether the light is cooperating or not. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G3 X camera: the large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more light; and the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with exceptional clarity and detail. 
25x, f/2.8-5.6 Optical Zoom Lens (24-600mm) - The PowerShot G3 X incorporates a powerful 25x Optical Zoom (24-600mm) lens for seamless telephoto shooting and unmatched versatility. You'll capture everything from the widest landscapes to dynamic close-ups in precise detail - all without changing a lens. The culmination of decades of EF lens know-how, the bright, all-new f/2.8-5.6 lens uses cutting-edge construction to prevent aberration and peripheral illumination loss over the entire telephoto range, delivering reliably high image quality with every shot. The lens's 9-blade aperture diaphragm creates beautiful circular background blur. Micro USM II drives the high-speed, silent zoom, with smooth, high-precision focusing for professional-quality video shooting. 
Intelligent IS - It's easy to capture clear, steady images with PowerShot digital cameras, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation - allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.
High-resolution Multi-angle Touch Panel LCD - The PowerShot G3 X camera's LCD screen can tilt up 180°, so taking that perfect selfie is a snap! In fact, the multi-angle LCD encourages creative framing because it's easy to achieve a flexible array of camera angles. Capacitive touch-panel operation feels familiar right away: simply touch to access quick control settings, focus and shutter release right on screen. A resolution of 1.62 million pixels makes the glare-free display ultra crisp and clear, so it's easy to compose your shots, choose camera settings, and review and share your images. 
1080p Full HD and Expanded Movie Options - With its large sensor and high performance lens the PowerShot G3 X camera creates spectacular 1080p Full HD video, but this premium model takes video-making even further with several high-end features. Set video capture to your shooting needs: 24p, 30p or 60p, with MP4 format available for easy sharing. Advanced audio includes expanded dynamic range, better S/N ratio, and external microphone and headphone jacks. Improved Dynamic IS significantly reduces shaking caused by handheld shooting. Manual controls (Av, Tv and ISO) can be set prior to and during shooting for full creative expression, and Manual Focus is also available. Shooting to commercial specifications is now possible with five aspect ratio grid line options, HDMI Live Out for checking images on an external monitor, and an Advanced Tripod Hole for smooth panning and tilting.   
Full Resolution Continuous Shooting and High-Speed AF - Powered by the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, the PowerShot G3 X camera gives you a seamless, high-speed continuous shooting (up to 5.9 fps) experience that's fully available in P, Tv, Av, M and Auto modes. Shooting and processing are now performed in tandem, reducing buffering time to deliver high shooting speeds. With the higher AF speed (up to approx. 0.20 seconds), achieving focus nearly the instant the camera is aimed is made possible. With no separate mode setting and no reduction in image quality, you can freeze brilliant action shots with ease.
31 AF Points - With 31 focus points arranged in an expanded, wide pattern across the image plane, the PowerShot G3 X camera focuses with admirable speed and precision. Smaller focus frame sizes also make it possible to obtain accurate focus on small subjects. The PowerShot G3 X also supports 1-point and Touch AF.
Built-in Wi-Fi makes sharing quick and easy - Built-in Wi-Fi technology for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends, family and the whole world. Easily post your images to social networking and media sites - Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and Google Drive - through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY directly from your PowerShot camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both iOS and Android devices, and upload images via the free Canon Camera Connect app without a computer. You can control the destination of your uploads to share with everyone or to selected groups, and even add comments. Sharing video is also easy with Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras, which record video using the easy-to-share MP4 format. Enhanced Wi-Fi makes posting in real time possible, so you can keep everyone up to date with photos and video even as events unfold. Wi-Fi technology also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer. 
Built‐in NFC (Near Field Communication) - PowerShot digital cameras with built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) technology eliminates the need to manually find and open the new Canon Camera Connect app on your mobile device. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android device, and the Camera Connect app will launch automatically for quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simpler to install the app. If the app hasn't been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically. Now, NFC helps ensure making a connection to a compatible Android device truly seamless. Simply touch the camera against an NFC-equipped device with the Canon Camera Connect app installed, and the Wi-Fi connection is established - no camera operations required. Even if your camera is off, NFC turns the camera on and establishes the connection (confirming the camera's nickname and privacy settings before the first connection is required).
Remote Shooting with the Camera Connect App - Remote shooting functions of the PowerShot G3 X camera through your smartphone or tablet has been vastly improved with the new Canon Camera Connect app. Now a variety of the camera's expressive capabilities are available to you: use different shooting modes (P, Av, Tv, M, Custom); enjoy multi-aspect shooting and display; choose AF frame modes (single-point/face detection); shoot in continuous shooting mode; and utilize the AF button. In addition, the new Camera Connect app is now universal to PowerShot and Canon EOS cameras with built-in Wi-Fi, so if you switch between cameras, operation is easy and familiar.
Mobile Device Connect Button - The camera's dedicated Mobile Device Connect Button gives you one‐touch access to your compatible mobile device or computer (utilizing Image Sync function). You can transfer photos and videos to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing to a computer on the same network. When the camera finds a linked computer on the same wireless network, images are sent directly to it. Otherwise, images are temporarily stored on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY then transferred once a connection is made - very convenient when you're on vacation or out for the day. 
Image Sync Function  - The Image Sync Function has been improved and expanded. In addition to wirelessly transferring photos and videos through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY to your computer, now you can view and download them from your smartphone. Take them anywhere, anytime, and use your familiar smartphone operations to view and share them.  
Compatibility with Canon Connect Station CS100  - The PowerShot G3 X camera is fully compatible with Canon's brand new photo and video storage device: Connect Station CS100. By simply tapping with NFC, photos and videos are wirelessly transferred to the Connect Station, where up to 1 TB of hard drive space and simple menus make them easy to store, manage and sort by albums, date or device name. From there, images and videos can be viewed in Full HD on an HDTV (via an HDMI cable), sent to compatible wireless printers, viewed/uploaded/downloaded from smartphones and tablets or PCs, and shared with other Canon Connect Stations and on social networking sites.  
Convenient controls provide intuitive manual adjustment - The PowerShot G3 X camera's thoughtfully designed controls will satisfy even advanced photographers. The front dial makes easy setting changes possible, with customizable zoom, Tv and Av assignments. An exposure compensation dial is easily accessed from the secure, concave thumb grip, and keeps pace as you quickly and actively create images. A controller wheel and dedicated Movie button all contribute to the camera's quick, convenient operability. 
Hot Shoe and Compatibility with EOS Accessories - The camera's integrated hot shoe allows you to attach exciting EOS accessories including all of the Canon Speedlite flashes. Long preferred by professionals, Speedlite flashes illuminate with natural beauty for notable depth and texture. Other available EOS accessories include Speedlite Transmitter ST-E3-RT, Off-Camera Shoe Cord OC-E3, and Remote Switch RS-60E3 to help make night scenes and macros sharper. 
Optional Electronic Viewfinder EVF-DC1 - The optional Electronic Viewfinder EVF-DC1 offers a high-resolution view and displays all shooting information in a brilliant and easily attached accessory. Mounted on the accessory shoe, the electronic viewfinder has a high eyepoint - perfect for those wearing glasses - and has a high precision XGA resolution LCD with 2.36 Million dots and displays the exact information found on the camera's LCD screen.

The camera can be directed to switch automatically between the LCD and the viewfinder with an eyepiece sensor, or can be set manually with a dedicated button. Brightness can be set independently from the camera's screen, perfect for discreet operation.
Star Shooting Mode - Starry skies were formerly out of reach to all but experienced SLR camera users, however, star shooting modes on the PowerShot G3 X camera make these wonderfully impressive images accessible to all. With just a tripod and simple settings, you can capture exquisite Star Nightscapes, Star Trails and Star Time-Lapse Movies. The modes can be performed fully automatically or with manual controls for extra versatility. Support functions including Night Display, Color Adjustment and Star Emphasis make any starry sky easier to capture.
Dust- and water-resistant construction - Just like with select EOS models, the PowerShot G3 X camera features pinpoint alignment and rubber sealing that results in dust- and drip-proof durability. Along with the camera's extreme versatility, this convenient rain- and dust-resistance make the PowerShot G3 X camera the ideal take-along in various weather conditions.
Bulb Exposure - Perfect for night scenes, fireworks, and other situations where predicting exposure length can be difficult, bulb exposure mode exposes the shot as long as the shutter button is held down - giving you complete control over the image. A tripod and the RS-60E3 Remote Switch are recommended when using this mode. 
RAW  - As with many EOS DSLR cameras, the PowerShot G3 X camera uses a 14-bit converter to process the output of the CMOS sensor, resulting in true color, smooth tonal transitions and natural gradations. The PowerShot G3 X lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with Canon's powerful bundled software. The camera also allows you to record in RAW and JPEG formats simultaneously. Now, in RAW mode, you can even select among several aspect ratios, including 16:9, 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1.

samys-57967f2892bb8f184640fdf1d02a71e6,D5 Digital SLR Camera Body (XQD Model),USD,6496.95,Nikon,,http://schema.org/InStock,"What determines when Nikon releases a full-frame flagship camera? When  technological innovation demands it. Introducing the Nikon D5 Digital SLR Camera Body (XQD Model), an FX-format  DSLR that makes the impossible possible. Huge advancements in sensor  design, autofocus, metering and image processing result in thrilling new  capabilities-low light shooting all the way to ISO 102,400 (expandable  to an unheard of ISO 3,280,000), precise AF detection and tracking  across that entire ISO range, regardless of your subject's speed or  direction changes, blazing fast 12 fps continuous shooting, 4K UHD video  and, of course, image quality that captures the hearts and minds of  your viewers. This is not iteration, friends. This is  innovation...spectacular innovation. How will it change the way you  shoot?FEATURES: 

Nikon's widest native ISO range ever - The low light performance of the D5 might make it a legend. With Nikon's widest native ISO range (100 to 102,400) and highest expanded range (up to Hi-5 ISO 3,280,000), advancements in noise reduction and color fidelity and a next-generation AF system that performs in near darkness (EV -4), a world of new shooting opportunities has opened. Capture clear, sharp images you may not have attempted before at night, in dark reception halls, arenas and more. For surveillance and security applications, this expanded ISO range means getting a shot others can't see without a flash.
Masterful image quality - The sheer imaging power of the D5 is exhilarating. With its Nikon developed 20.8MP FX-format CMOS sensor, the D5 is the highest resolution full-frame Nikon flagship ever and ready for your next challenge. Nikon's superior image processor has been updated to EXPEED 5 to harness the power of this remarkable new sensor, and a second processor has been added just for autofocus. All of the exquisite detail and textures, vibrant colors and rich tonality delivered by NIKKOR lenses is captured in flawless precision, even in extreme low light. Create images that move people.
The speed to capture decisive moments - When you hear the D5 shooting at full speed,12 fps with fulltime AF and AE, 14 fps with fixed focus and AE with the mirror up, you know the game has changed. For the first time in a Nikon DSLR, a second processor is dedicated solely to autofocus operation and computing. A new shutter and mirror sequencing mechanism nearly eliminates blackout time and mirror slap for bright, consistent views during high-speed capture. EXPEED 5 and a high performance buffer handle up 200 NEF (RAW) and/or Large JPEG images during one high-speed burst, enough to cover an entire 100m sprint without taking your finger off the shutter release button. The new 180K RGB Advanced Scene Recognition System pulls it all together and ensures every shot has optimal exposure.
Nikon's fastest, most accurate AF system yet - The D5 ushers in a new era of autofocus with the Multi-CAM 20K AF sensor module. It uses 153 focus points with 99--yes 99--cross-type sensors and a fully dedicated AF processor, and it works in near darkness (EV -4). Small subjects moving at high speed, even in low light, can be tracked with remarkable precision. The system is configurable in 153-, 72- and 25-point coverage when used with Continuous AF. All 153 points are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses f/5.6 or faster, and 15 central points work with an effective aperture of f/8. Whether you're shooting a high-speed race or A-listers on the red carpet, the D5 has you covered.
4K UHD video in light others wouldn't dare - For the first time in a full-frame Nikon DSLR, record 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) video with dot-by-dot readout for maximum image quality. Capture 3840 x 2160 at 30/25/24p with an angle of view approx. 1.5x lens focal length, or record Full HD 1080 video at 60/30/24p. Shoot stunning 4K UHD Time-lapse, right in camera.

Combine the D5's low light capabilities and the versatility of NIKKOR lenses, and your next video project is bound to be acclaimed.
A smooth operator - Incorporating feedback from the field, the D5 is engineered to reduce the stress factors of shooting all day. Improved ergonomics and an expanded illuminated button layout put key controls at your fingertips. A high resolution XGA Touchscreen LCD with a smartphone-like interface makes it easy to select AF points or Spot White Balance in Live View, swipe through shots, pinch to zoom, edit file names and more. New double XQD card slots easily handle the camera's incredible burst shooting capacity and keep the buffer cleared.

samys-580feb7da20a64c61f15f3f4039cae8f,PowerShot G3 X Digital Camera,USD,999.00,Canon,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The Canon PowerShot G3 X Digital Camera can be ideal for capturing and sharing all  your adventures, indoors and out. With a compact, rugged design that’s  easy to carry, this premium camera gives you inspirational image quality  through its 1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor,  plus the power to zoom to an incredible 25x. You’ll be able to capture  what you see wherever life takes you: broad, majestic landscapes,  virtually blur-free low-light images, and beautifully detailed wildlife.  You can also capture action as it happens in beautiful 1080p Full HD  video, and share your images/videos with easy Wi-Fi connectivity, which  now includes built-in NFC for touch communication with a compatible  Android device. Whether you’re traveling around the world or  enjoying your favorite outdoor activities close to home, you’ll want to  pack the PowerShot G3 X camera.FEATURES: 

1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor - The PowerShot G3 X camera’s 1.0-inch sensor achieves a beautiful balance between high sensitivity and high image quality. The sensor is able to collect more light in a shorter time period without the overflow that causes blown-out highlights. This means better detail and sophisticated tonal quality, with rich gradations even at high ISO speeds all the way to 12800. A high signal-to-noise ratio delivers minimal noise and distortion with breathtaking dynamic range, particularly notable in bright areas. And photography enthusiasts will appreciate the changes in image processing for the PowerShot G3 X, which include target exposure value and contrast characteristics of highlights. Thanks to this change, dynamic range in bright areas is expanded with gradation attributes that are similar to EOS. Also, by changing the exposure index standard, it is possible to shoot at almost the same brightness with the same aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings as EOS. The PowerShot G3 X natively captures images in the 3:2 aspect ratio, which is the same as Canon EOS SLR cameras. The camera’s image creation technology was designed with post processing in mind, and features an Aspect Ratio function, enabling RAW image capture in 16:9, 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1 aspect ratios while maintaining the same angle of view.
Canon DIGIC 6 Image Processor - The PowerShot G3 X camera is powered by the latest iteration of Canon’s proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which takes still and video image quality to a beautiful new level. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot G3 X, powering full resolution high-speed continuous still shooting (even in P, Av, Tv and M modes) and the advanced star shooting modes. The processor allows for MP4 video recording for better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. The new processor also supports an MF Peaking function, giving you a pro-level focusing tool.
Canon HS SYSTEM - The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen, whether the light is cooperating or not. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G3 X camera: the large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more light; and the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with exceptional clarity and detail. 
25x, f/2.8–5.6 Optical Zoom Lens (24–600mm) - The PowerShot G3 X incorporates a powerful 25x Optical Zoom (24–600mm) lens for seamless telephoto shooting and unmatched versatility. You’ll capture everything from the widest landscapes to dynamic close-ups in precise detail – all without changing a lens. The culmination of decades of EF lens know-how, the bright, all-new f/2.8–5.6 lens uses cutting-edge construction to prevent aberration and peripheral illumination loss over the entire telephoto range, delivering reliably high image quality with every shot. The lens’s 9-blade aperture diaphragm creates beautiful circular background blur. Micro USM II drives the high-speed, silent zoom, with smooth, high-precision focusing for professional-quality video shooting. 
Intelligent IS - It's easy to capture clear, steady images with PowerShot digital cameras, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.
High-resolution Multi-angle Touch Panel LCD - The PowerShot G3 X camera’s LCD screen can tilt up 180°, so taking that perfect selfie is a snap! In fact, the multi-angle LCD encourages creative framing because it’s easy to achieve a flexible array of camera angles. Capacitive touch-panel operation feels familiar right away: simply touch to access quick control settings, focus and shutter release right on screen. A resolution of 1.62 million pixels makes the glare-free display ultra crisp and clear, so it’s easy to compose your shots, choose camera settings, and review and share your images. 
1080p Full HD and Expanded Movie Options - With its large sensor and high performance lens the PowerShot G3 X camera creates spectacular 1080p Full HD video, but this premium model takes video-making even further with several high-end features. Set video capture to your shooting needs: 24p, 30p or 60p, with MP4 format available for easy sharing. Advanced audio includes expanded dynamic range, better S/N ratio, and external microphone and headphone jacks. Improved Dynamic IS significantly reduces shaking caused by handheld shooting. Manual controls (Av, Tv and ISO) can be set prior to and during shooting for full creative expression, and Manual Focus is also available. Shooting to commercial specifications is now possible with five aspect ratio grid line options, HDMI Live Out for checking images on an external monitor, and an Advanced Tripod Hole for smooth panning and tilting.   
Full Resolution Continuous Shooting and High-Speed AF - Powered by the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, the PowerShot G3 X camera gives you a seamless, high-speed continuous shooting (up to 5.9 fps) experience that's fully available in P, Tv, Av, M and Auto modes. Shooting and processing are now performed in tandem, reducing buffering time to deliver high shooting speeds. With the higher AF speed (up to approx. 0.20 seconds), achieving focus nearly the instant the camera is aimed is made possible. With no separate mode setting and no reduction in image quality, you can freeze brilliant action shots with ease.
31 AF Points - With 31 focus points arranged in an expanded, wide pattern across the image plane, the PowerShot G3 X camera focuses with admirable speed and precision. Smaller focus frame sizes also make it possible to obtain accurate focus on small subjects. The PowerShot G3 X also supports 1-point and Touch AF.
Built-in Wi-Fi makes sharing quick and easy - Built-in Wi-Fi technology for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends, family and the whole world. Easily post your images to social networking and media sites – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and Google Drive – through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY directly from your PowerShot camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both iOS and Android devices, and upload images via the free Canon Camera Connect app without a computer. You can control the destination of your uploads to share with everyone or to selected groups, and even add comments. Sharing video is also easy with Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras, which record video using the easy-to-share MP4 format. Enhanced Wi-Fi makes posting in real time possible, so you can keep everyone up to date with photos and video even as events unfold. Wi-Fi technology also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer. 
Built‐in NFC (Near Field Communication) - PowerShot digital cameras with built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) technology eliminates the need to manually find and open the new Canon Camera Connect app on your mobile device. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android device, and the Camera Connect app will launch automatically for quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simpler to install the app. If the app hasn't been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically.

Simply touch the camera against an NFC-equipped device with the Canon Camera Connect app installed, and the Wi-Fi connection is established – no camera operations required. Even if your camera is off, NFC turns the camera on and establishes the connection (confirming the camera’s nickname and privacy settings before the first connection is required).
Remote Shooting with the Camera Connect App - Remote shooting functions of the PowerShot G3 X camera through your smartphone or tablet has been vastly improved with the new Canon Camera Connect app. Now a variety of the camera’s expressive capabilities are available to you: use different shooting modes (P, Av, Tv, M, Custom); enjoy multi-aspect shooting and display; choose AF frame modes (single-point/face detection); shoot in continuous shooting mode; and utilize the AF button. In addition, the new Camera Connect app is now universal to PowerShot and Canon EOS cameras with built-in Wi-Fi, so if you switch between cameras, operation is easy and familiar.
Mobile Device Connect Button - The camera’s dedicated Mobile Device Connect Button gives you one‐touch access to your compatible mobile device or computer (utilizing Image Sync function). You can transfer photos and videos to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing to a computer on the same network. When the camera finds a linked computer on the same wireless network, images are sent directly to it. Otherwise, images are temporarily stored on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY then transferred once a connection is made – very convenient when you’re on vacation or out for the day. 
Image Sync Function  - The Image Sync Function has been improved and expanded. In addition to wirelessly transferring photos and videos through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY to your computer, now you can view and download them from your smartphone. Take them anywhere, anytime, and use your familiar smartphone operations to view and share them.  
Compatibility with Canon Connect Station CS100  - The PowerShot G3 X camera is fully compatible with Canon’s brand new photo and video storage device: Connect Station CS100. By simply tapping with NFC, photos and videos are wirelessly transferred to the Connect Station, where up to 1 TB of hard drive space and simple menus make them easy to store, manage and sort by albums, date or device name. From there, images and videos can be viewed in Full HD on an HDTV (via an HDMI cable), sent to compatible wireless printers, viewed/uploaded/downloaded from smartphones and tablets or PCs, and shared with other Canon Connect Stations and on social networking sites.  
Convenient controls provide intuitive manual adjustment - The PowerShot G3 X camera’s thoughtfully designed controls will satisfy even advanced photographers.

An exposure compensation dial is easily accessed from the secure, concave thumb grip, and keeps pace as you quickly and actively create images. A controller wheel and dedicated Movie button all contribute to the camera’s quick, convenient operability. 
Hot Shoe and Compatibility with EOS Accessories - The camera’s integrated hot shoe allows you to attach exciting EOS accessories including all of the Canon Speedlite flashes. Long preferred by professionals, Speedlite flashes illuminate with natural beauty for notable depth and texture. Other available EOS accessories include Speedlite Transmitter ST-E3-RT, Off-Camera Shoe Cord OC-E3, and Remote Switch RS-60E3 to help make night scenes and macros sharper. 
Optional Electronic Viewfinder EVF-DC1 - The optional Electronic Viewfinder EVF-DC1 offers a high-resolution view and displays all shooting information in a brilliant and easily attached accessory. Mounted on the accessory shoe, the electronic viewfinder has a high eyepoint – perfect for those wearing glasses – and has a high precision XGA resolution LCD with 2.36 Million dots and displays the exact information found on the camera's LCD screen. It offers a dioptric adjustment range of -3.0 to +1.0 and can tilt up to 90°, helping to enable steady shooting even on an angle. The camera can be directed to switch automatically between the LCD and the viewfinder with an eyepiece sensor, or can be set manually with a dedicated button. Brightness can be set independently from the camera's screen, perfect for discreet operation.
Star Shooting Mode - Starry skies were formerly out of reach to all but experienced SLR camera users, however, star shooting modes on the PowerShot G3 X camera make these wonderfully impressive images accessible to all. With just a tripod and simple settings, you can capture exquisite Star Nightscapes, Star Trails and Star Time-Lapse Movies. The modes can be performed fully automatically or with manual controls for extra versatility. Support functions including Night Display, Color Adjustment and Star Emphasis make any starry sky easier to capture.
Dust- and water-resistant construction - Just like with select EOS models, the PowerShot G3 X camera features pinpoint alignment and rubber sealing that results in dust- and drip-proof durability. Along with the camera’s extreme versatility, this convenient rain- and dust-resistance make the PowerShot G3 X camera the ideal take-along in various weather conditions.
Bulb Exposure - Perfect for night scenes, fireworks, and other situations where predicting exposure length can be difficult, bulb exposure mode exposes the shot as long as the shutter button is held down – giving you complete control over the image. A tripod and the RS-60E3 Remote Switch are recommended when using this mode. 
RAW  - As with many EOS DSLR cameras, the PowerShot G3 X camera uses a 14-bit converter to process the output of the CMOS sensor, resulting in true color, smooth tonal transitions and natural gradations. The PowerShot G3 X lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with Canon's powerful bundled software.

With its 24.3MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS III sensor and  high-performance X  Processor Pro image processing engine, the X-T2  fulfills  the high standards of the FUJIFILM X system. The addition of  4K/2K video  takes it one step beyond. With a string of features   including high speed 1/32000 shutter, Intelligent Hybrid Phase detection   AF, weather resistant body, 3-way tilting 3.0” LCD, 2.36  Million dots  EVF and dual SD UHS-II memory card slots, the X-T2 makes a  fitting  successor to the popular FUJIFILM X-T1.FEATURES:24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III Sensor - The FUJIFILM X-T2 features a 24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III APS-C sensor for outstanding image quality. Its highly random pixel array effectively reduces moiré and false colors without the use of an optical low-pass filter. When combined with an XF lens, the sensor delivers images with a perceived resolution far greater than the number of pixels used. Other features include outstanding read speed, high-speed continuous shooting, high-precision AF tracking, highly faster liveview refresh rate and superb video recording.Excellent image processing from X-Processor Pro - The X-Processor Pro image processing engine is approximately four times faster than the previous model. The increased built-in memory and enhanced computational power bring out the maximum capabilities of the X-Trans CMOS III sensor. It produces high quality images and improves response times for shorter delays between shots, reduced shutter-release time lag and greater AF precision. The engine also delivers faster Live View refresh rates and reduces image delay when tracking moving subjects.Larger high-speed and high-precision phase detection AF area coupled with performance improvements - AF performance has been improved in a number of keys areas. The fast and accurate phase detection AF now covers a larger part of the frame and has been optimized in the area where users are most likely to position the main subject. At the same time, the FUJIFILM X-T2 boasts significant focusing improvements on small highlights, low contrast subjects and subjects with fine textures, which have previously caused problems for focal plane phase detection AF. Contrast detection AF, which excels in low light conditions, has also received a performance boost, with the ability to accurately focus in light levels as low as -3EV. The camera also refocuses more regularly during the slow burst mode in AF-C.Eye Detection AF automatically detects human eyes - Choose Face Detection to automatically detect human faces, or turn on Eye Detection AF to automatically detect and accurately focus on human eyes for successful portraits with a shallow depth of field. You can also define the area of priority focus, for example right or left eye, or the eye closer to the camera. These functions have been upgraded for improved accuracy to a level that will impress professional photographers. They are particularly effective when shooting with the XF56mmF1.2 R / XF56mmF1.2 R APD or XF90mmF2 R LM WR lenses.Pinpoint accurate focusing in MF mode - The FUJIFILM X-T2 has a variety of functions that assist pinpoint focusing in the MF mode. Set the Focus Mode Lever to MF and rotate the focus ring to access a variety of MF Assist functions. These include Focus Peaking, in which color is used to show the parts of the image that are in focus, and Digital Split Image, where focus is achieved by lining up the split image strips in the center. These features are particularly useful in macro photography and portraiture, which involve a shallow depth of field and require focusing precision.Focus Lever to instantly change the focusing point - The focus area can be changed in eight directions using the FUJIFILM X-T2's Focus Lever: up/down, right/left and diagonally. This allows users to make quick changes to the focus area for accurate focusing after composing an image. This feature is useful not only to shift the AF points during autofocusing, but also to quickly choose the area to be enlarged in MF Assist mode during manual focusing.Three parameters controlling AF-C - Fujifilm has substantially improved the AF-C algorithm to boost the accuracy of the FUJIFILM X-T2's ability to track moving subjects. You can now fine tune how the camera reacts to the way the subject moves within the frame, how fast the subject moves and where in the frame the camera prioritizes focus. The five presets in the AF-C Custom Settings represent combinations of these three factors.AF-C Custom Settings - The AF-C Custom Setting allows you to select one of five AF presets according to the subject's movements to obtain perfect focus tracking. Based on how the subject moves, you can select a preset from, for example, Preset 2: Ignoring obstacles, Preset 3: For subjects that accelerate / decelerate, Preset 4: For subjects that suddenly come into the frame or Preset 5: Subjects with erratic movements to obtain optimum settings for accurate subject tracking. A combination of three factors: Tracking sensitivity, Speed tracking sensitivity and Zone area switching, may be manually set and registered as Preset 6: Custom.High-resolution Real Time Viewfinder with a 0.77x magnification ratio - The 2.36-million-dot high-resolution organic EL electronic viewfinder has a magnification ratio of 0.77x, a horizontal viewing angle of 31 degrees, and a display time lag of just 0.005 seconds. The viewfinder, which is 2 times brighter than the previous model, also features an automatic brightness adjustment function so it's easy to see in all conditions - even intense backlighting. It completely eliminates moiré or false colors, and boasts performance comparable to an optical viewfinder, but with the added advantage of displaying a live view that reflects exposure settings.Up to 100 fps EVF refresh rate for a clear display even in low light - As standard, the EVF refreshes at a rate of 60 fps, but in Boost mode this jumps to 100fps, which continuously displays even fast-moving subjects smoothly to deliver a performance comparable to that of an optical viewfinder. The fast refresh rate is maintained even in low light for easy framing during night shooting.Focusing on subjects with erratic movements - Continuous shooting performance has also been improved, enabling up to 11fps when using the mechanical shutter* and 5fps in the Live View mode. The viewfinder blackout time is now less than half that of the previous model. This means that you can track a fast-moving subject more easily for an extended period of time during continuous shooting. The combination of advanced continuous shooting options and EVF performance deliver continuous AF-C shooting never previously thought possible with mirrorless cameras.Film Simulation on video recording - Film Simulation modes are available during video recording. Movie shooters can enjoy extra creativity, without the need for lengthy post-production, including monochrome video in ACROS and documentary-themed tones in CLASSIC CHROME. You can also change settings such as aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation while recording video.Simultaneous HDMI output to an external monitor - Video can be output via HDMI during recording, allowing you to simultaneously check footage on the camera's LCD monitor or EVF and an external monitor. The data can even be recorded onto an external recorder as you film in the uncompressed format. As for 4K movie, you can choose log gamma ""F-Log"" to record a wider dynamic range than normal video mode.Solid body with resistance to dust, moisture and low temperatures - The FUJIFILM X-T2's body is made of magnesium alloy. Despite being compact and lightweight, it is both solid and highly durable. The body is also weather-sealed in 63 points to achieve a high level of resistance to dust and moisture. Couple this with its ability to work in temperatures down to -10°C and you'll see the camera is ready for anything. Similar weather-sealing is applied to the dust-resistant and water-resistant lenses and the Power Booster Grip to provide weather resistance across the entire system.Exceptionally balanced for a comfortable and reliable grip - The FUJIFILM X-T1's grip has been further developed and now offers even greater comfort on the FUJIFILM X-T2 thanks to a larger area set aside as a thumb rest. Locking mechanisms have also been introduced for the SD Card Cover and Battery Cover.Three-direction tilting LCD screen - The FUJIFILM X-T2 features a premium LCD screen that can tilt in three directions.

MF assist and peaking - Manual focus becomes much easier because peaking highlights the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors (white, red, or yellow). This is especially helpful during macro or portrait photography where your focus setting can make or break your shot.
Picture Effect mode - Realize your creative potential with Picture Effect, a fun and simple way to convert ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Effects are Soft Focus, Posterization, Retro Photo, High Contrast Monochrome, Rich-tone Monochrome, Miniature, Soft High-key, Toy Camera, Pop Color, Partial Color, Watercolor Painting, HDR Painting, and Illustration.
Superior Auto mode - Get cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using Backlight Correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.
Bright F1.8 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T lens with 3.6x zoom - Large-diameter F1.8 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T lens delivers refined background defocusing - bokeh. A premium multi-layered T coating also dramatically reduces ghost and flare caused by light reflection.

Capture the decisive moment with up to 10fps - Capture full 20.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.
Optical SteadyShot with Active Mode - Optical SteadyShot with Active Mode for blur-free movies even while walking.4 Camera-shake compensation using Optical SteadyShot/Active Mode has been improved with the addition of new electronic image stabilization. Now it’s easier than ever to obtain sharp, blur-free movies even when zooming in unsteady situations, such as shooting with one hand while walking.
Auto portrait framing - Simply photograph a person and Auto Portrait Framing will save an additional, optimally framed image in portrait or landscape orientation. Combining Face Detection and By Pixel Super Resolution technologies with rule of thirds, Auto Portrait Framing provides beautifully composed and appealingly balanced full resolution portraits.
Multi-aspect ratio recording for still images - Capture still images in any of four aspect ratios — 1:1, 2:3, 4:3, or 16:9 (vertical to horizontal). This provided the freedom to choose a ratio that matches the scene or the specific shooting purpose.
Four focusing modes - This camera has two Autofocus modes: Single-shot AF (AF-S) or Continuous AF (AF-C), which tracks moving objects. It also has Manual Focus for manual focusing freedom, and Direct Manual Focus (DMF), that first uses autofocusing to focus on the subject, and then allows fast and easy switching to manual focusing for even more precise adjustment.
Multi-frame noise reduction - In this mode, the camera automatically shoots multiple images and layers them to produce a single noise-free image. This method provides noise reduction equivalent to a 2-stop lower shutter speed while maintaining the same aperture setting. Since the Multi Frame NR mode can be used in combination with P/A/S/M modes, it expands the user’s shooting flexibility.
Creative Style settings - Control how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, B&W, Sunset, Portrait and Landscape. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste.
Intelligent Scene Recognition mode - Intelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes for photos and 44 scenes for movies, and then selects the appropriate camera settings. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.
P/A/S/M modes for video and stills - Enjoy a full range of controls for video and still shooting from the beginner's iAUTO mode to P/A/S/M: Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills, build your confidence and exercise greater creative control.
Low-light ISO 6400 sensitivity - Incredibly clear low-light pictures without sacrificing detail, made possible by the low-noise Exmor CMOS image sensor and refined BIONZ image processor.

The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.
Memory recall - MR (memory recall) mode can memorize up to three groups of the user's preferred settings. Settings include zoom magnification, white balance, exposure compensation, date, and grid lines. This enables quick switching of settings at the right moment.
Auto HDR mode - Captures more scene dynamic range than a single exposure can handle—and more range than photo film. Combines the best highlight detail from one shot, the best mid-tones from a second and the best shadow detail from a third for one incredible shot (up to 6 EV stops). Captures in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.)
3.6x optical/7.2x Clear Image digital zoom - Most digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom digitally doubles optical zoom for closer photos.
Digital level gauge - Digital level gauge to allow easier leveling of the camera
Photo Creativity - The Photo Creativity interface enables you to easily enjoy the creative expression of SLR-quality digital imaging without complex jargon. Changes can be combined/ removed and viewed in real time on the LCD making it a breeze to make adjustments.

To counter the effects of conventional, spring-driven SLR mirrors, the EOS 5DS features a newly developed Mirror Vibration Control system. The camera's mirror is not controlled by springs but instead is driven by a small motor and cams. This system suppresses the impact typical of the camera's mirror, significantly reducing impact and its effects on the image. A new Time Release Lag setting, easily accessed on the Canon EOS 5DS's menu system, offers added protection against camera shake by setting the shutter release time intentionally longer so the camera does not begin the exposure until after the impact of the camera's mirror has diffused.


Anti-flicker feature - With Canon's Anti-flicker function, the Canon EOS 5DS camera is able to deliver accurate results under cycling lighting situations. Under flickering light, such as fluorescent lighting, a fast shutter speed may result in an irregular exposure. The Canon EOS 5DS's Anti-flicker function detects the frequency and phase of the flicker and captures images near the point of peak brightness when the subject is most likely well illuminated.


Built-in intervalometer and bulb timer - The Canon EOS 5DS camera offers time-lapse fixed-point shooting and long exposures without the need for a remote control. The Canon EOS 5DS's interval timer takes from 1 to 99 shots at preselected intervals (from 1 second to 99 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds, or unlimited), ideal for shooting flowers as they bloom or clouds drifting through the sky. Captured exposures can even be collected and saved as an HD movie. Its built-in bulb timer keeps the shutter open for a designated amount of time, perfect for night photography, to capture the flow of traffic on a street corner, or any other situation where long exposure photography is warranted.


1.3x and 1.6x crop shooting - For still photography, the Canon EOS 5DS camera features the flexibility of a cropping feature that extends the shooting effect 1.3x and 1.6x. With 50.6 Megapixel capture, cropped shots are possible with plenty of resolution to spare. Images recorded at 1.3x (APS-H) are approximately 30.5 Megapixels (6768 x 4512) Large/Fine JPEG, while images recorded at 1.6x (APS-C) are approximately 19.6 Megapixels (5424 x 3616) Large/Fine JPEG. Particularly useful in extending the range of telephoto lenses, the crop function also improves the Canon EOS 5DS's subject tracking capability with almost the entire frame covered with AF points. Image cropping can be displayed in the viewfinder either masked or overlaid with an outline showing the cropped area, and in Live View shooting the image is cropped by the effect chosen. Aspect ratios can also be defined, with the Canon EOS 5DS shooting in 1:1, 4:3, and 16:9 ratios, in addition to the default 3:2.


Intelligent Viewfinder II - The Canon EOS 5DS camera's Intelligent Viewfinder II makes it easy to both shoot, change and confirm camera settings and shooting modes all without looking away from the viewfinder. Displaying approximately 100% of the composition, the viewfinder can show settings like shooting mode, exposure level, white balance, drive mode, AF operation, metering mode, recording format, an electronic level and more. All of this information can be displayed by or superimposed easily over the image for review while shooting, and multiple views are customizable through the Canon EOS 5DS's simple user interface.


Full HD 30p movie capability - The Canon EOS 5DS camera is a sophisticated movie-making machine, capturing Full HD movies with numerous manual controls at multiple frame rates and compressions. Featuring movie capture and manual controls, the Canon EOS 5DS's shutter button can be programmed to capture still images when pressed during movie shooting.


Time Lapse Movie function - An EOS first, the Canon EOS 5DS camera even has a time-lapse movie feature that takes still photos at set intervals and joins them to create a silent movie. Perfect for showing the moving clouds across the sky, growth of a plant, changes in scenery, the flow of people walking and more, the Canon EOS 5DS's Time Lapse Movie function creates professional-quality movies, in camera, without the need for a computer, saving precious time when out in the field.


High-speed continuous shooting - The Canon EOS 5DS camera can continuously shoot up to 5.0 frames per second. Thanks to its speedy dual DIGIC 6 Image Processors plus its enhanced shutter mechanism and mirror drive, the Canon EOS 5DS is capable of capturing full 50.6 Megapixel images at high speed with superb quality. This sophisticated balance between high pixel count and shooting speed ensures the Canon EOS 5DS is always ready for the next shot.


3.2-inch ClearView II LCD Monitor - The 3.2-inch ClearView II LCD monitor has 1,040,000 dots, anti-reflective construction and features Canon's ClearView technology for a bright, sharp display in any number of shooting situations.

A concept that has been epitomised by Leica since Oskar Barnack laid the foundations for 35 mm photography more than a hundred years ago, with the original Leica. This concept has been central to our company’s philosophy - based on the art of engineering on one hand, and on visionary risk-taking on the other. A philosophy that leads to innovation, rewriting photographic history again and again. As it has with the new Leica Q, a camera which continues this groundbreaking Leica tradition with a full-frame sensor and a fixed-focus lens.Whether your subject involves depth of field, an available-light situation or a macro photography shot, the Summilux 28mm f/1.7 ASPH. provides everything you need to express yourself photographically.

The controls of the Leica Q provide quick access to all relevant options and opportunities. For example, auto-focus can be set either using buttons or via the touch screen. Prefer to focus manually?  Then let the innovative Live View aids “Focus-Peaking” and “Live View Zoom” assist you. Easy to use, the Leica Q helps you implement your ideas perfectly - at the press of a button.The built-in Wi-Fi module on the Leica Q makes it easy to share your pictures and videos on social networks.

The app can also generate a live image from the camera and settings can be controlled though the app as well.Features: 

Large 12.8MP 4/3"" MOS Sensor: The large area of the 17.3 x 13.0mm sensor contributes to better control of depth of field as well as improved shadow detail over versus smaller-sensor cameras. Details, contrast, and colors are accurately captured too.
Fast f/1.7-2.8 Leica DC Vario-Summilux Lens: The integrated f/1.7-2.8 Leica DC Vario-Summilux Lens maintains excellent light-gathering ability even when fully zoomed, helping to free the user from exposure limitations, even in low light. This 3.1x optical zoom lens provides an angle of view equivalent to a 24-75mm lens on a 35mm film camera and is optically stabilized to help counteract blur caused by user movement.
Excellent Low-Light Performance: Along with a large sensor and a bright lens at all focal lengths, and ISO range of 100 to 25,600 helps to ensure that low-light is not an obstacle to capturing the image.

High-Resolution Viewing Options: Images and videos can be played back on the camera's large, sharp 3.0"" 921k-dot rear LCD display. When it is preferable to use a viewfinder, the camera camera's integrated electronic viewfinder can be used instead.
Wireless Connectivity: Paring the with a smartphone or tablet is made easy with integrated Near Field Communication (NFC) and Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n capability. Devices with the Leica Image Shuttle app can have images sent to them as images are taken with the camera. The app can also be used to show a live image from the camera or to control camera settings.
Multiple Exposure Modes and Tactile Control: Exposure modes include program, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, manual, as well as 22 creative control modes. Exposure set can be quickly set via an aperture ring and shutter speed dial.

samys-707b39b39c6456de85847434b3453a21,X100F Digital Camera (Silver),USD,1299.00,Fujifilm,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The Fujifilm X100F Digital Camera (Silver) signifies the  achievement of new heights in Fujifilm's endless pursuit of perfection  in photography. Perfection means creating a system that allows  photographers to control, frame, and create with style, ease, and  purpose. A long-anticipated iteration of the X100 series, the FUJIFILM  X100F is a powerful addition to FUJIFILM X Series, offering  photographers the versatility of endless creativity.FEATURES:Newly Developed APS-C Sensor, X-Trans CMOS III - The Fujifilm X100F features the X-Trans CMOS III sensor specifically  designed for the X Series. The X-Trans CMOS III uses an aperiodic color  filter array to eliminate the need for an optical low-pass filter. The  24.3MP APS-C sensor controls noise beautifully despite its increased  pixel count, allowing the standard sensitivity range to be boosted to  ISO12800, which was in the extended sensitivity range in previous  models. Additionally, the phase detection area has been expanded to  enable phase detection AF, allowing the camera to function with greater  speed and accuracy than ever before.    All New Engine, X-Processor Pro - The Fujifilm X100F uses newly developed X-Processor Pro as its image  processing engine, achieving processing speeds of about 4 times faster  than previous models. It draws out the full capability of the X-Trans  CMOS III sensor which supports high-speed data read to dramatically  improve response time. The X-Processor Pro also helps display a moving  subject more smoothly, thanks to the improvement of the refresh rate to  60fps for the LCD monitor and EVF's Live View mode. The engine has  reduced the camera's startup time to approx. 0.5 seconds, shortening the  time required from powering on to shooting - so you won't miss a beat.    Expanded Phase Detection AF Area - The Fujifilm X100F features phase detection AF using phase detection  pixels on the sensor. The phase detection area on the sensor has been  increased by approx. 230% as compared to previous models. The camera  uses 91 focus points (up to 325 points) for high-speed and high-accuracy  focusing as compared to 49 points in previous models The AF algorithm  itself has been revised to ensure accurate focusing even in difficult  conditions such as low-contrast scenes in overcast weather.    Built-In ISO Dial - New features in the Fujifilm X100F include the Built-In ISO Dial,  incorporated into the Shutter Speed Dial reminiscent of film cameras of  yesteryear, the focus lever, which allows you to instantaneously move  the focus area without having to take your eye off the viewfinder, and  the 'C' position for enabling ±5 stop exposure compensation. Most of the  operation-related buttons and dials are concentrated on the right-hand  side to allow quick change of settings while firmly holding the camera.Focus Lever For Quick Selection Of Focus Areas - The Fujifilm X100F is the first lens-integrated X Series camera that  features the Focus Lever. It moves in eight directions (up / down, right  / left and diagonally) so that you can swiftly move your AF point  selection while maintaining composition.    Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder - The Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder combines the features of an optical  viewfinder (OVF) and electronic viewfinder (EVF). Operate the viewfinder  switch lever at the front of the camera body to instantly switch  between OVF and EVF. You can also apply the electronic display which  shows a focus area over the OVF screen to take advantage of Focus  Peaking and Digital Split Image functions even in the OVF mode for  accurate focusing in real time.The Electronic Rangefinder shows  the EVF in a small window at the bottom right corner of the OVF. The EVF  in the ERF mode has 100% finder coverage and can display a focus area  in 2.5x and 6x magnification. While composing with the OVF, you can  check the EVF window for exposure, white balance and other details to be  reflected in your actual pictures. Use the MF Assist function for  highly accurate manual focusing.    Real Time Parallax Correction - Parallax, i.e. a displacement of the shooting frame in the viewfinder  from the actual area to be photographed especially in close-ups, is  automatically corrected in real time. Even in OVF mode, the X100F  automatically corrects the position of the shooting frame and focus area  upon focusing, and displays them correctly for more accurate  composition.    'C' Position For Enabling ±5-Step Exposure Compensation - The ergonomically placed exposure compensation dial supports  compensation of up to ±3-step in 1/3 steps. Put the dial into 'C'  position and operate the Front Command Dial to achieve exposure  compensation of up to ±5-step while checking the results in your EVF in  real time. This lets you capture perfectly exposed moments exactly as  intended.Choice Of Six AF Modes To Suit Each Scene - The Fujifilm X100F offers AF-S for stationary subjects and AF-C for  moving subjects. For both options, you can choose either Single Point  AF, Zone AF or Wide / Tracking AF, in which the camera automatically  selects multiple areas for focusing. In the Single Point AF and Zone AF  modes, use the Focus Lever beside the LCD monitor to instantaneously  change the location and size of focus areas.    Film Simulation Modes - A  manufacturer of photographic film for over 80 years, Fujifilm has  always been dedicated to achieving premium image quality across both  analog and digital spectrums. The Fujifilm X100F features 15 Film  Simulation options including PROVIA/Standard, Velvia/Vivid and  ASTIA/Soft, which are named after Fujifilm's most renowned photographic  films. They deliver warm skin tones, crisp blue hues of the sky and  vivid green of lush greenery exactly as your mind remembers in your  memory. This is the first X100 Series model to feature ACROS, delivering  smooth gradation, deep blacks and beautiful textures that set it apart  from the conventional Monochrome mode.    Ultra-Fast Electronic Shutter At 1/32000 Sec - Featuring a durable leaf shutter that withstands 100,000 actuations and  an electronic shutter with silent operation, the Fujifilm X100F is a  formidable photographic tool. When operating on electronic shutter, the  camera delivers an ultra-high shutter speed of up to 1/32000 sec to  achieve correct exposure even in strong daylight or when shooting with  the aperture wide open. You can switch the shutter sound setting to Off  in a quiet church or during a concert for total discretion.    Extended Full-HD Video Recording - Full  HD video recording is supported in six frame rates (59.94p / 50p /  29.97p / 25p / 24p / 23.98p) with improved AF tracking performance as  compared to previous models. You can adjust aperture, shutter speed and  exposure compensation settings while recording. Film Simulation effects  can also be applied to video for versatile and artistic video output.Advanced Filters - Use this function to apply various filter effects to broaden your scope  of artistic expressions. There are eight filters available, including  High Key for reduced contrast and brighter tones overall, Toy Camera for  a retro appearance, and Partial Color for retaining a specific color  range and turning the rest into monochrome. You can check the filter  effect in real time while shooting through your EVF and LCD.    Three-Stop Built-In ND Filter - The Fujifilm X100F's lens has a built-in ND filter, which is useful  when shooting with the aperture wide open in bright light, or when  opting to use a slow shutter speed. The three-stop ND filter, which cuts  down the amount of light to 1/8, can be activated easily with the  function button or from the camera menu.    Conversion Lenses - The WCL-X100 II Wide Conversion and the TCL-X100 II Teleconversion  Lenses expand the Fujifilm X100F's shooting field while perfectly  retaining the advanced image quality and performance of the camera's  fixed Fujinon 23mmF2 Prime Lens. Their elegant design, created  specifically for the X100 Series, is in total harmony with the Fujifilm  X100F. These conversion lenses are optically designed to draw out the  performance of Fujifilm X100F's lens to the maximum extent, delivering  premium image quality without affecting the lens' f-stop value. The  camera body automatically recognizes when a conversion lens is mounted  and displays framing guidelines indicating the shooting area when in OVF  mode.    Digital Teleconverter - Activate the  Digital Teleconverter to achieve an angle of view equivalent to 50mm or  70mm in addition to the built-in 35mm perspective. This function is  perfect for discreetly getting a little closer or to accentuate certain  features in your frame. Using the EVF or LCD to check your image in real  time allows you to maintain full concentration on your subject matter  while shooting.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-050137x1500.jpg,,,,,,,

samys-76b92cfa2af727a59d0e4abe6bef7c1a,12 FPS Digital Mirrorless Medium Format Camera Body,USD,8426.54,Alpa,,http://schema.org/InStock,"The ALPA 12 FPS Digital Mirrorless Medium Format Camera Body is probably the most astounding mirrorless medium-format camera for digital backs. It offers an integrated and electronically controlled focal plane shutter, runs with extremely low vibrations and has a fastest exposure time of 1/4000 sec. It is also possible to use mechanical and electronic leaf shutters – installed in the lens – for particularly short flash synchronization speed. This opens up a whole range of lenses, from the brand new to the tried and tested, of different manufacture and design, to be used with the ALPA 12 FPS which thus allows the direct use of the respective properties and specific characters of the individual optics. A constantly growing selection of ALPA precision adapters with and without adjustment mechanisms allows the use of the FPS in the most varied photographic areas. A single camera can now be used at the highest possible level for taking situations from macro to landscape, from repro to architecture or from photo reportage to studio work.Further exceptional properties and features of the ALPA 12 FPS, which may even be unique on their own or in combination include: electronic aperture control, remote control, wide range exposure bracketing, multiple exposures, simple user interface, flexible programmability, continuous expansion of functions through uploadable firmware and much, much more. Only a short time ago, photographers could only dream of a camera with these options – this dream has now become reality with the ALPA 12 FPS.ALPA 12 FPS, focal plane shutter camera/module with electronically controlled focal plane shutter, with 2 batteries, charger, front-/back protection covers, movements integrated: none or depending on third party lens, adapter or with a shiftable ALPA 12 body and ALPA lenses; with corresponding adapters tilt or swing movements of up to 5° are possible with lenses in the correct tube, without hand gripFeatures: 

Design and usability: The ALPA 12 FPS is distinguished by a clearly laid out and easily accessible keypad, which, together with the rotary knob that can be clicked, makes it possible to adjust the camera rapidly. More infrequently used menu items (such as setting up the network parameters) have been relegated to a dedicated “configuration” sub-menu, so as to keep the user interface lean and well arranged. With ALPA, you will find intuitive controls and adjustment wheels dispersed over the entire camera, and you will also not come across any fiddly switches or buttons.
Extreme modularity: In spite of its very smooth and tidy design, the ALPA 12 FPS comes with a V-shaped or 3/8″ thread on each of its four narrow sides, to which various accessories can be attached: Along with the obligatory quick release plates for tripods are also various handles for the right and left-hand sides, which can be extended with inserts for both mechanical and electronic release.
The remote control: Special photographic situations necessitate special solutions. It is not only when used in architectural and industrial photography that spectacular perspectives and at the same time challenging locations for photography increasingly need to be administered; even studio stills of large objects (whether it be cars or furniture) often require raised positions. The ALPA 12 FPS is well suited for this, as it can be perfectly operated via remote control.
Extreme wide angles: By deliberately refraining from using an instant-return mirror (which some obsolete in the age of CMOS sensors), a focal length that is sensationally small for a medium format camera ¬ could be implemented with the ALPA FPS. This enables not only adaptation to numerous different medium format lenses (see next point), but also the use of small image lenses with Nikon F or Canon EOS bayonet mount.
Shift Modules: The ALPA 12 FPS is, however, by a long chalk, not only an outstanding “stand-alone camera”, but also a valuable extension of the existing ALPA system. Thus, the ALPA 12 FPS may also serve as a “shutter module” for existing ALPA cameras, which then, combined with SB-34 lenses (50mm, 90mm, 120mm, 150mm and 180mm) take on the function of a “shift module” (e.g. with the ALPA 12 SWA, STC, MAX and XY). These lenses can alternatively also be used in combination with the 17mm tilt/swing FPS adaptor for extending the sharpness in accordance with the Scheimpflug technique.
The FPS focal plane shutter: The “ALPA 12 FPS” not only derives its name from the “focal plane shutter”, but it is simultaneously also one of its most convincing details. Its assembly position permits a procedure with very little vibration, and the fully electronic timing is another asset for the aspiring photographer. The rapid 1/4000 sec exposure not only makes it possible to take photographs in very bright environments, but also to “freeze” fast movements (whether it be of the motif or the camera (platform), such as in aerial photography). However, not only short times are possible; long exposures (of up to 128 secs) can be implemented as well.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-026980x1500.jpg,,,,,,,
samys-7777c6f9a77441b37fe5993bbd465356,M Monochrom Limited Edition Jim Marshal Set,USD,12950.00,Leica,,http://schema.org/InStock,"Leica Camera and the Jim Marshall Estate are proud to offer a limited edition set of the LEICA M Monochrom ""Jim Marshall Set"" with LEICA SUMMILUX-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH to celebrate Jim's legacy and his life-long relationship with Leica Camera. This edition is limited to 50 sets and will be sold worldwide exclusively through Leica Stores and Boutiques. The numbered and Jim Marshall autographed LEICA M Monochrom (Type 246) and LEICA SUMMILUX-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH are made of brass components with a very special ""Laiton"" finish which provides a unique matt finish and a one of a kind appearance for each set. Another distinctive component of the set is the lens. This lens, while modern in its optical design, has the classic knurled focus ring and round lens hood reminiscent of the 1960's. Both are made of brass with the ""Laiton"" finish. The set also includes a Jim Marshall Limited Edition Estate print of Thelonious Monk at the Monterey Jazz Festival 1964 and a special, numbered edition and estate embossed copy of the Jim Marshall Jazz Festival published by Reel Art Press. During the extraordinary rise of popular culture and the counterculture in the 1960""s, Jim Marshall seemed to be everywhere that mattered. His images of the Monterey Pop Festival chronicling the breakout performances of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding are woven into the lore of the era. Jim shot more than 500 album covers. His photographs are in private and museum collections around the world. With the Leica M Monochrom Limited Edition Jim Marshal Set, characteristic toning effects from analogue black-and-white photography can be applied to images at the touch of a button. Simply save the exposure in JPEG format and select the desired toning effect - it's as easy as that, and creates fascinating results.Photographers who consciously employ the unique aesthetics of black-and-white photography to express their creativity can rely on the Leica M Monochrom as a modern tool. As the successor to the world's first digital black-and-white camera, it offers the latest technologies to support creative visualization in its archetypal form. For pictures of unequalled quality. For pictures with previously unimaginable sharpness, depth and clarity. A pioneer in every respect. A true Leica. Black-and-white photography with unrivaled speed: with the Leica Maestro, the Leica M Monochrom not only features the same high-performance processor as its counterpart with color vision, the Leica M, but also offers the extra speed reserves of a 2 GB buffer memory. This enables sequential shooting at three times the speed of the previous model - with pictures in the exceptional M quality photographers expect. The pictures are instantaneously available for display in review mode and written as JPEG files and/or RAW data in DNG format to the memory card. Leica M Monochrom - the sharpest way to see things in black and white: thanks to a high-resolution 24-megapixel sensor that captures images in 35 mm full-frame format - with three times the speed of its predecessor. As the sensor records only luminance values, this leads to 100% sharper pictures with an exceptional depth, clarity and resolution of details that by far exceed those of color exposures - even when shooting with the highest ISO sensitivity settings. Pictures that already satisfy professional demands in JPEG format. Video at the press of a button: the Leica M Monochrom has a separate release button for activating video recording in 1080p full-HD format. Thanks to a dedicated adapter, the legendary R-series lenses can also be used for recording video with all available functions. Perfect sound is ensured by an optional Leica microphone adapter set, comprising an adapter and a stereo microphone.Discreet and solidly built, the Leica M Monochrom brings all the essentials anyone could ever need for unobtrusive photography - to last a lifetime, if you wish. Its endurance is guaranteed by the superior quality and solidity of the materials that go into its construction - top deck and baseplate are machined from solid brass and the camera body is engineered from high-strength magnesium alloy. Equally hard-wearing is the extremely scratch-resistant and almost unbreakable sapphire glass cover plate for its LCD monitor. This reduction to the essentials is what makes it a true Leica. The omission of color filters in front of the sensor allows more light to reach its surface. More light for aesthetic, pin-sharp and finely resolved exposures at sensitivities up to ISO 25000. Pictures that possess a finely grained noise signature at the highest ISO values that are reminiscent of the look of analogue photos. Thanks to the combination of low susceptibility to noise, a bright viewfinder/rangefinder, a low-vibration shutter release and fast lenses, the Leica M Monochrom opens up entirely new dimensions for available-light photography. By modifying the conversion of colors to greyscale values, yellow, green and orange lens filters - calculated especially for use with the Leica M Monochrom - offer new opportunities for the exploration of creative effects with light and contrast. This means that the color of the filter in the original scene becomes brighter and its complementary color darker. This is effective for creating unusual moods in landscapes, portraits and other genres of photography. At the same time, multilayer coating reduces reflections and ensures high transmission without vignetting. In Live View mode, the high-resolution 3"" monitor with a resolution of 921,600 pixels enables complete control of composition, framing, exposure, focusing and depth of field. Live View also offers two additional focusing methods: Live View Zoom for tenfold magnification of the scene or subject, and Focus Peaking, which automatically marks the edges of objects in color when they are sharply focused.

Focus on challenging situations - Whether you’re capturing images in daylight or after dusk, the D7200's superb AF system will keep up.

One center AF point even works all the way to f/8, for greater focusing performance when using teleconverters.
Freedom of expression - Create dazzling artistic images right in the camera. The D7200 includes auto bracketing up to 9 frames and built-in HDR for creating images with stunning dynamic range.

A powerful, nimble imaging system - The D7200 can be the centerpiece of your photography system for many years. The D7200's built-in flash can wirelessly trigger and control remote Speedlights with i-TTL communication in Commander Mode. Streamline your workflow with high-speed data transfers using the optional UT-1 Communication Unit for wired LAN connection, or wirelessly connect to an FTP server or computer with the UT-1 with the optional WT-5A/B/C/D.

Also supporting the K-3 II's use in trying conditions is a durable magnesium alloy and stainless steel body design that incorporates 92 distinct seals to render it water, cold, and dust-resistant. A large 0.95x optical pentaprism viewfinder permits bright, eye-level viewing with 100% frame coverage while a 3.2"" 1.03m-dot LCD monitor allows for accurate live view shooting and image playback.Features: 

24.35 MP APS-C CMOS Sensor and PRIME III Processor: A large 24.35 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and PRIME III image processing engine work together to enable high-resolution imaging and full HD video recording with notable low-light sensitivity from ISO 100-51200. The image processor also contributes to a wealth of shooting speed for the camera, including a top full-resolution continuous shooting rate of 8.3 fps for up to 23 consecutive RAW images or 60 JPEGs and a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 sec. This highly durable, advanced shutter mechanism employs a three-motor system that independently regulates the shutter, mirror, and diaphragm to minimize mirror shock for accurately-rendered images when shooting at higher frame rates.
Selectable Anti-Aliasing Filter: A unique and innovative mechanism allows you to toggle an anti-aliasing filter effect either on or off, providing support for both the high-resolution abilities of a filter-less design as well as advanced moiré protection. With the filter in the Off position, the camera is more prone to acquiring maximum sharpness, resolution, and detail from an image for the highest attainable image quality. When the filter position is set to either Type1 or Type2, an anti-aliasing simulator applies microscopic vibrations to the image sensor unit during exposure; working to create the same effect as an optical anti-aliasing filter. Having both options available extends the camera's versatility and allows personalized selection of the benefits best-suited to individual applications. Additionally, AA filter simulation settings can also be bracketed for times when the likelihood of moiré is unknown.
Pixel Shift Resolution and Diffraction Correction: For increasing the effective resolving power, reducing noise, and achieving a more refined color palette, Pixel Shift Resolution technology composited four sequentially recorded stills while shifting the image sensor in one pixel increments in each direction after each exposure. This allows each pixel to record its own unique set of RGB data, rather than having each pixel record only red, green, or blue values per exposure and de-mosaicing or interpolating this information to form a final image. Since no interpolation is used, truer colors and reduced noise is possible, as well as increased edge sharpness and apparent clarity. This mode is most effective when photographing stationary objects from a tripod due to the extended duration and precision required during the process. Also helping to increase sharpness, a Diffraction Correction function offers an effective two stop improvement in regard to the effects of diffraction and other aberrations common to working with smaller aperture sizes. This technology is possible due to the heightened processing capabilities of the PRIME III engine, and can also be applied to imagery during in-camera raw file development.
SAFOX11 Autofocus System: The SAFOX11 autofocus system employs 27 distinct phase-detection points, including 25 cross-type sensors, to quickly and accurately acquire focus on subjects in a variety of lighting conditions. Three central points also cover an f/2.8 luminance flux to extended sensitivity when working in lighting conditions as low as -3 EV. Also benefitting autofocus performance, the 86k-pixel RGB exposure metering sensor, light source sensor, and AF assist light help to further refine the focusing accuracy despite working in challenging situations. The AF-C (continuous AF) algorithm also benefits from the use of the exposure metering sensor, which aids in maintaining responsive and accurate tracking performance on moving subjects, especially when moving perpendicular to the camera. AF-S (single-shot AF) performance has also been increased and requires less redundant movement, or fine-adjustment hunting, prior to acquiring focus.
86k-Pixel RGB Sensor Exposure Metering: In addition to benefitting the AF performance of the K-3 II, the 86k-pixel RGB sensor also helps to ensure accurate and consistent exposure metering with a range of -3 to +20 EV. A Real-Time Scene Analysis System analyzes the scene and subject at hand, and employs exposure meter readings and both color distribution and color movement detection to produce an exposure capable of best-rendering subjects.
Sensor-Shift Type Shake Reduction: With the inclusion of a high sensitivity gyro sensor, in-camera sensor-shift type Shake Reduction (SR) works to minimize the appearance of camera shake by 4.5 EV steps when using any mounted lens. Ideal for working in low-light conditions or with longer lenses, since the image stabilization is located within the body, both past, legacy lenses as well as current Pentax lenses all receive the benefits of SR. This image stabilization system can also detect horizontal panning motion and compensate for the lateral movement during shooting.
GPS, Electronic Compass, and AstroTracer: A built-in GPS module and electronic compass allow you to geotag your imagery during shooting for plotting to interactive maps to track where and when your shots were made on Google Earth. Also benefitting from the GPS module, as well as the Shake Reduction sensor-shift mechanism, the K-3 II features a unique AstroTracer function to better enable making long exposures of the nighttime sky. Using the GPS coordinates and orientation of the camera, the image sensor will shift during the course of an exposure in order to compensate for the Earth's rotation and prevent star trails from occurring; resulting in sharper, clearer imagery and alleviating the need for an optional equatorial mount.
Full HD 1080p Video Recording and Time Lapse Movies: Full HD 1920 x 1080 video recording is supported in multiple frame rates, including 60i, 50i, 30p, 25p, and 24p, in the high-quality H.264 format. HD 1280 x 720 video is also supported in 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, and 24p frame rates. Audio can be recorded along with video using the built-in microphone or, additionally, a 3.5mm microphone terminal is available for use of an external mic. Beyond standard movie recording, an interval timer can also be used for making time-lapse sequences, which can be saved at 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) and compiled into a Motion JPEG file for seamless playback. The interval timer allows you to record up to 2,000 consecutive frames with an interval of 2 seconds to 24 hours between each frame, and a 2 second to 24 hour time delay available. When compositing frames, you can use Additive, Average, or Bright settings to smooth the transitions between frames.
A      rigid magnesium alloy shell over a stainless steel chassis renders the K-3      II fully weather-resistant, cold-proof to temperatures as low as 14°F, and      sealed against dust and moisture using 92 independent seals.
The      optical pentaprism viewfinder offers 100% frame coverage and has a 0.95x      magnification. Additionally, interchangeable optional focusing screens can      be used depending on different focusing, viewing, and compositional needs.
A      large 3.2"" 1.03m-dot LCD monitor enables working in live view when      shooting or recording movies, and also benefits clear image playback and      menu navigation. The screen has adjustable brightness, contrast, and color      settings, an air-gapless design, and an anti-reflective coating for easier      viewing in bright conditions.
Dual      SD memory card slots for greater storage flexibility and potential storage      capacity when shooting.
The      shutter mechanism has been tested for 200,000 actuations for ensured      durability.
Dust      Removal II function helps to maintain a clean, dust- and particle-free      sensor surface.
USB      3.0 interface permits fast file transfers when connected to a computer.
A      unique Hyper Operation System offers seamless control over both shutter      and aperture-priority shooting when working in the Program mode. By      turning the front e-dial, you can utilize shutter speed priority while      maintaining the correct exposure settings, and the rear e-dial permits      working with aperture-priority settings. The green button can be pressed      to return to the original Program settings.
Using      the optional FluCard memory card for Pentax, this camera can pair with      mobile devices over Wi-Fi for wireless image transfer and remote camera      control. Optional Eye-Fi memory cards are also supported.
Multi-pattern      white balance recognizes and independently analyzes different lighting      sources and types within an image and applies separate white balance      adjustments to optimize the overall color reproduction.
In-camera      HDR shooting is possible for attaining greater highlight and shadow detail      than a single exposure allows for. This mode records three separate      exposures, with 1, 2, or 3 EV differences, and blends them together into a      single frame.
Multiple      exposure shooting is possible in composite mode with additive, average,      and bright settings for 2 to 2,000 individual exposures.
Native      support is offered for both Pentax PEF and Adobe DNG 14-bit RAW file      types. It is also possible to retrieve RAW data from JPEG files if still      present in the camera's buffer memory.

The first new camera in years to accept Polaroid 600-type instant film, the I-1 is a fresh take on a classic, offering the legendary format with advanced features and capabilities. The I-1 makes real photos, that you can pin to the wall or give to a friend. Photos with a life after the shutter clicks. The I-1's advanced ring flash adapts to your environment, capturing your subject in the right light no matter where you shoot. The optional I-1 App for iOS lets you do even more with your camera. Access useful additional features, add creative effects to your images and experiment with manual controls. Take full control of every aspect of your exposures: use Manual Mode to adjust aperture, shutter speed, flash and focus distance. Use the remote trigger to stay in the frame when shooting from a distance. Or use the self timer to take a selfie without the awkward angles. Superimpose images on top of each other. Paint with light and color. Trigger a shot with a loud noise. The I-1 App lets you have fun with digital effects in an analog environment. For imaging, the camera relies on an 82-109mm lens with a 5-zone autofocus system. The changes are slight and composition is made easy with a removable pop-up optical viewfinder on the top of the camera.I-type film is optimized for I-type cameras. It's cheaper and more energy efficient than our standard film, because it doesn't contain batteries - unlike classic Polaroid® cameras, the I-1 doesn't need them. You can also use the I-1 with any 600 type film. Every instant photo is the result of a complex chemical chain reaction. It begins when light enters the camera and is reflected onto the film to expose an image. The exposed photo is then coated in developer paste as it leaves the camera, so you can watch it come to life in the palm of your hand. One of the signatures of classic Polaroid images is the flash, and the I-1 brings it to modern times with an advanced ring flash that offers twelve LEDs to illuminate your subject. Using and iOS or WatchOS device, photographers can take full control over the camera, including full manual operation, remote triggering, and even a variety of creative modes. Additionally, the camera has a built-in USB-rechargeable lithium-ion battery that allows it to work with I-type film that doesn't not have a battery pack.Features: 

Use your phone as a wireless remote for the I-1, triggering it from a distance or for selfies and group pictures.
Take full control over aperture, shutter speed, flash strength, and focus distance.
Set the I-1 to capture a photo after a 5, 10, or 20 second delay.
Superimpose two images on a single piece of instant film by exposing the single sheet twice.
Trigger a photo by making a loud noise like a click or a clap.
 Use your phone's flashlight to draw lines and shapes with light on your photos or selectively illuminate areas of a darkened scene.
Draw waves of colored light onto your images before they develop by picking a color from your phone's screen and moving it in front of the lens as the camera prepares the photo.
Allows you to take a digital photo of your instant photo, crop the frame, and then share it online.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-045146x2000.jpg,,,,,,,

The EOS M10 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 15-45mm Lens (Black) & Connect Station CS100 combines a lightweight, compact design with the power and  image quality EOS cameras are known for along with the versatility of  interchangeable lenses. Inside is an 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor  that's paired with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor to help capture colorful,  detailed videos and photos, even in low-light situations. To help  expand creative opportunities, the EOS M10 is compatible with a wide  range of compact EF-M lenses specially designed for EOS M series digital  cameras, and the extensive range of EF and EF-S lenses used with  Canon's DSLR cameras. It also has easy-to-use and automatic settings  like the innovative Creative Assist to simplify photo adjustments and  help ensure your images are how you want them. Self Portrait mode  extends that assistance to help you grab great selfies by adjusting  settings that smooth skin tones and artistically blur backgrounds. If  it's too dark for a normal photo, a built-in pop-up flash lights up dark  spaces. All these powerful features combine to make the EOS M10 worthy  of your attention, while being conveniently wrapped in a slim, stylish  camera.FEATURES: 

Legendary Image Quality in the Palm of Your Hand - The EOS M10 camera features a lightweight, comfortably designed body that's easy to hold and take with you. From overseas vacations to backyard family gatherings, the EOS M10's compact size means it can easily be on hand, without getting in the way. A built-in thumb grip also lets you grasp the body securely, while the rounded edges make holding the camera easier when recording long video clips. All this while still featuring the image quality for which Canon EOS cameras are so well known.
18.0 Megapixel Sensor - The 18.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor captures lots of detail with very little image noise. The sensor itself is APS-C type, which is the same size as the sensor found in Canon's EOS Rebel series of cameras. The high resolution means you can crop the image to focus on one section, or have enough detail to print large photos to display or give to your family and friends. An ISO range of 100-12800 (expandable to 25600) lets you capture images on bright sunny beaches and darkened streets.
DIGIC 6 Image Processor - Complementing the EOS M10's camera's CMOS sensor, Canon's DIGIC 6 Image Processor not only speeds up camera operations, but also helps enhance a number of the camera's advanced features. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor aids the camera's sensor in capturing detailed images with reduced noise at high ISOs and enables high-quality movie capture with a number of different movie compressions including MP4. On top of that, it enhances the camera's Dynamic Image Stabilization system and even helps improve the AF system's face detection accuracy.
Fast Focus - Life happens fast, and there's little worse than missing out on capturing that perfect moment because the camera was too slow to focus. The EOS M10 camera uses Canon's Hybrid CMOS AF II autofocus system, which measures up to 49 different points in an image quickly and accurately to help get it in focus. In addition, face detection and object tracking help keep the subject of your photo focused, even if they move. What's more, the EOS M10 is compatible with all EF-M lenses, which feature an AF+MF mode that lets you easily combine the speed of autofocus with the creative flourish possible with manual focus.
3.0-inch Tilt-type LCD Monitor - It's vital to see if you've composed the photo you want. The EOS M10 camera's 3.0-inch touch screen has 1.04 million pixels, letting you preview images in high detail. It can pivot a full 180°, meaning you can capture a unique dog's-eye-view of the world or flip the screen up to get that epic selfie.
Intuitive Touch Screen for Selfies, Quick Focusing and Shooting and Easy Menu Navigation - Thanks to a clean menu design and a responsive 3.0-inch touchscreen, the EOS M10 camera is simple to use. A single touch lets you select where in the image you want to focus, helping ensure the photo you take is the photo you want. Menus are easily accessible with either hand, so you don't have to take your finger off the shutter to adjust a setting quickly. Scrolling through images you've taken is as easy as a swipe, and you can zoom in to check detail and focus with two fingers
Full HD Videos at 24p and 30p in MP4 Format - The EOS M10 camera can capture 1920x1080 Full HD video at frame rates of both 24p and 30p, and can record in MP4 format for easy sharing online.
Moviemaking Made Easy with Manual Movie Control - The EOS M10 camera is a fine moviemaking tool. With touch-activated AF and a number of manual controls available, it's easy to make intuitive setting adjustments silently and on the fly using the EOS M10's dials and touch operations.
Creative Photographic Options - With its built-in Creative Assist feature, the EOS M10 camera makes it simple to change camera settings in real time and see the effects as they happen. Whether adjusting brightness, sharpness, contrast, color tone and intensity or even moving to monochromatic images, the EOS M10 makes it easy for novices and professionals alike to find just the right look to match the emotion or tone of the image. Up to six personal settings can be saved and applied anytime when composing other images. Additionally, images shared from other photographers can be imported into the EOS M10, which can then display their settings and even apply them to the scene at hand. By helping the photographer to understand how different settings affect the look and feel of the photo or video, the EOS M10 can be an excellent learning tool. 
Your Stunning Selfie - Everyone wants to look great in photos, and the EOS M10 camera's Self Portrait mode helps make sure your selfie catches you looking incredible. It's accessible in the menu, or via a shortcut button when the touch screen is flipped all the way up. Self Portrait mode can make adjustments ranging from smooth skin tones and background blurring to brightness and more. On top of that, a customizable self-timer helps makes sure you capture the picture you want, whether you need two seconds to flash a quick smile or ten seconds to gather your friends together for a group photo. 
Easy-to-use Built-in Flash - Sometimes a scene is just too dark for a camera to capture. The compact and powerful built-in flash pops up when needed, and snaps back into the body when it isn't. It's a quick burst of light to help capture a last photo of your friends before everyone heads home for the night. 
Built-in Wi-Fi - The EOS M10 camera is designed to make Wi-Fi connections fast and easy. It can exchange data with other Wi-Fi compatible Canon cameras, connect directly to Canon's Connect Station CS100 device, upload directly to various web services like CANON iMAGE GATEWAY, Facebook and YouTube, and even play back images and movies on DLNA-compatible digital electronics.
Built-in NFC Capability - With its built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) capability, the EOS M10 camera connects directly to NFC-compliant Android devices by simply touching the NFC icon located on the camera to the device.
Remote Shooting & Wireless Printing - With the Canon Camera Connect app installed, the EOS M10 camera connects to and can be controlled by your compatible smartphone or tablet for simple remote shooting. Plus, it can also connect and print directly to IP-compatible printers.
Expanding Creativity with EF and EF-S Lenses - The EOS M10 camera is compatible not only with the growing range of EF-M lenses tailor-made for EOS M series digital cameras, but also the extensive line of Canon EF and EF-S lenses available for other EOS cameras. This gives access to dozens of different creative choices. Want an ultra wide lens for crowd shots and big nature images? How about a telephoto for wildlife and close-up action shots?

It comes with the silver chrome and the black paint versions and is technically identical to the current models of the Leica M Camera.Equipped with a 24-megapixel full-frame Leica Max CMOS sensor, designed especially for use with M and R Lenses and with a multitude of features like Live View, full-HD video and additional focusing methods, the Leica M combines the capabilities of innovative, state-of-the-art digital technology with the latest developments from decades of expertise in rangefinder construction.The Leica M Edition 100 brings together a purely mechanical rangefinder camera for film photography – the Leica M-A – with a digital Leica M (Leica M Monochrom) in one set. Both cameras stand as symbols for the origins of Leica photography and the present day. The Leica M-A, with technical specifications based on the currently available Leica MP film camera. Alternatively, the second camera, a Leica M Monochrom, is the contemporary variation of the theme composed a century ago by Oskar Barnack. This is the first time that stainless steel has been employed for the visible metallic elements of Leica products. The set also includes three Leica Summilux-M lenses with focal lengths of 28, 35 and 50 mm and will be supplied in a black anodized aluminium case. The cameras and lenses will be available exclusively as sets from Leica Stores and Boutiques and strictly limited to 101 sets.Features: 

Maximum image quality: Superior sharpness and the finest reproduction of detail. The Leica M features a newly-designed, high resolution, 24-Megapixel CMOS sensor in full 35 mm format – the Leica Max 24-MP sensor. When combined with the Leica Maestro image processor, only outstanding images are created. Additionally, the low noise performance makes the M ideal for available-light photography.


Sharp images guaranteed: The classic rangefinder system offers fast, precise, crystal-clear focusing with superior accuracy. Two additional focusing methods allow for even more creativity. The new “Live View Zoom” enables up to 10A-magnification of the Live View display, and the “Live View Focus Peaking” automatically highlights sharp contours in red to provide simple focus control.


Motion pictures with Leica look: The unique quality of Leica lenses has been expanded into the 1080p, full-HD video recording feature of the Leica M. Complete control over exposure and capture settings enables photographers to complement their still images with professional video recordings, with the same look and quality inherent to Leica photography.


Faster results: The combination of the Leica Max 24-MP sensor and Leica’s Maestro processor allows for an extremely high image-processing speed. A low buffer time lets you take photos in rapid succession, not missing a single shot. The processor’s several independent segments permit an incoming image to be processed while a previous one is still being written on the memory card.


Universal capabilities: The new Leica M is the first to feature Live View. Images are composed from material produced by the lens, granting you complete control over depth of field, exposure, framing and focusing. The M’s large, high-resolution 3"" monitor with 920,000 pixels allows precise assessment of each potential image with regard to sharpness, exposure and colour.


Use in any weather conditions: Our cameras are built to last a lifetime. Solid brass blanks and full-metal bodies from high-strength magnesium alloy and scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla® Glass make bodies and screens resistant to life’s little tumbles. Specially designed rubber seals protect the cameras from splashes, moisture, dust and uncooperative weather.


For long-endurance missions: Leica M’s new lithium-ion battery (1800 mAh) is high performance and rechargeable, ensuring that you are comfortably prepared for long shoots. One single charge guarantees a large number of exposures, which makes the M perfect for shooting in remote locations.


Ergonomic handling: The Leica M combines the traditionally valued photographic functions of the M-System with state-of-the-art ergonomic features. With an ergonomically-positioned control wheel on the top plate, intuitive menu navigation and a newly-designed and user-friendly menu interface on the rear monitor, the photographer can concentrate on what’s essential – the images.


Compatibility with Leica R-Lenses: The Leica M can take full advantage of almost all lenses in the Leica R-Lenses series, thanks to the new, state-of-the-art Leica R-Adapter. This extensive lens range includes various wide-angle, telephoto and macro lenses as well as a selection of zooms.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/leica100th10794.jpg,,,,,,,

It unites decades of experience in rangefinder technology with groundbreaking digital technologies: It features a completely newly developed high-resolution full-format CMOS sensor that, in combination with its high-performance processor and the legendary M-Lenses, delivers outstanding imaging results. With Live View, video, and new additional focusing methods, it is also the M for photographers who do not wish to miss out on any of what modern digital technology has to offer.  Features 

Upper Normandy Revisited - Magnum Photographer Jean Gaumy Returns to his Roots: As a change from travelling through distant countries, globetrotting Magnum photographer Jean Gaumy captured impressions of his native region Upper Normandy – for Leica. With the new Leica M in his luggage, he has created an intensely personal ‘photo diary’ that provides an informal, almost intimate, view of this coastal region and its inhabitants.
Leica Max 24 MP Sensor for Maximum Imaging Quality: The Leica M features a completely newly designed high-resolution, 24 megapixel CMOS sensor in full 35 mm format. The combination of the camera’s image processor and this Leica Max 24 MP sensor guarantees outstanding imaging quality. Its intelligent design and flat pixel architecture enables each individual pixel to gather a particularly large amount of light. This results in images characterised by superior sharpness and maximum spatial resolution. The new M delivers extremely low-noise and richly detailed images, even at higher sensitivities of up to ISO 6400. And now, thanks to the 1080 pixel, full-HD video capability of the Leica M, the impressive imaging quality is available for moving pictures, too. The new CMOS sensor is designed and constructed for the use of both Leica M and R lenses on the Leica M. Because, with the new Leica R-Adapter M, almost all Leica-R legacy lenses can be used on the Leica M expanding the options of the Leica M into the world of Leica R photography.
Fast Leica Maestro Image Processor: In conjunction with the new sensor, the Leica Maestro processor lets the Leica M set entirely new standards in terms of image-processing speed. It processes the image data arriving from the sensor and transforms them into visible images at extremely high speeds and can also perform even the most complex processing steps very fast. Thanks to the energy-efficient imaging electronics of the processor and sensor, a single charge of the Leica M’s new 1800 mAh lithium-ion battery can last an extremely long time.
Universal Capabilities with Live View and the Electronic Viewfinder: The new Leica M is the first ever M to feature Live View and Live View Focusing. This means that now, for the first time, images can be composed using the actual image produced by the lens – with complete control of depth of field, exposure, precise framing and focusing. Its large, high-resolution 3"" monitor allows precise assessment of the subject seen through the lens. This opens up entirely new opportunities for M-Photographers that previously lay far beyond the limitations of rangefinder photography, like macro and telephoto exposures, or using the monitor as a viewfinder. Live View can be used with both M and R lenses. Indirectly, it also enables owners of R lenses to use the optional Visoflex EVF2 electronic viewfinder. The Leica M can be used with an R-Adapter, R-Lenses and a viewfinder exactly like an SLR, without using the monitor.
Splash-proof Camera Body: Thanks to the many years of experience gathered by our engineers in the construction of camera bodies, the new Leica M is built without compromise for maximum stability and perfect sealing. Its top and base plates are machined from solid brass, and its full-metal body is manufactured in one piece from high-strength magnesium alloy. Specially designed rubber seals protect the camera body against dust and water spray. The glass covering plate of its high-resolution monitor screen is manufactured from particularly tough and scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla glass. All this makes the Leica M particularly resilient and helps guarantee it a long and reliable working life.

Its high resolving power adopts the same gapless on-chip lens structure as the a7R and features the latest-generation RGB color filter and other cutting-edge device technologies developed by Sony, the number 1 manufacturer of image sensors. The a77II's image sensor exhibits approximately 20% higher sensitivity and lower noise levels compared to the a77 throughout a wide sensitivity range of ISO 100 to 25,600.The a77II is equipped with the same BIONZ(r) X image processing engine as on the top-of-the-line full-frame models-a7 and a7R. This engine achieves approximately three times the processing speed of previous BIONZ and features all the latest image processing technologies, which are optimized for this model. The result is astonishingly high-speed processing capabilities as well as faithfully reproduced textures and amazing definition.The a77II has the world's fastest continuous shooting speed in its class-up to 12 frames per second at full resolution. Equipped with a 79 point AF sensor and advanced auto focus tracking, technology, you never have to miss a moment. The a77II outperforms even more expensive rivals with continuous auto focus and auto exposure when shooting at 12fps at full 24.3MP resolution and can capture up to 60 frames in a single burst when in JPEG fine setting.The a77II is also equipped with a newly developed phase detection auto focus system, featuring wide coverage 79 AF points. Fifteen of the AF points are cross-type and placed in the most-frequently-used central area of the sensor. This helps the a77II achieve accurate focusing even with horizontally striped subjects, which line-type AF points typically find challenging. The new AF system also performs well in low-light conditions-as low as EV -2 (ISO 100), which is similar to a moonlit night under which objects are difficult to see even with the naked eye. The new AF algorithm instantly recognizes and reliably tracks the desired subject. The a77II also realizes impressive focusing accuracy, even when a large-aperture lens is mounted, thanks to the f/2.8 AF point placed horizontally in the center of the AF sensor overlapping another AF point.Strong outlines a common characteristic of digital images, are minimized as much as possible to achieve finely detailed images with a natural three-dimensional appearance and naturally depicts subjects as seen by human vision. This increases the ability to depict detailed textures and brings photography another step closer to creating totally realistic, high-quality images. Diffraction-reducing technology maximizes the optical performance of lenses and produces finer details when shooting with a small aperture setting. Optimal filter processing-that best matches the f-number-is applied to correct image points that are blurred, preventing diffraction effects that become an issue when shooting with a deep depth of field and high pixel count. You can therefore depend on finely detailed images even when shooting with a small aperture setting. The a77II has a wide sensitivity range of ISO 100 to 25,600 for faster shutter speeds and low-light shooting situations. Combined with detail reproduction technology, area-specific noise reduction effectively suppresses noise and realizes high-sensitivity images resulting in fine details and less grain from corner to corner. Connectivity with smartphones has been simplified with Wi-Fi(r) and NFC control for one-touch sharing. Simply tap the camera to another NFC-enabled device like a tablet or smartphone and photos are transferred with just one touch. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required.

Up to six personal settings can be saved and applied anytime when composing other images. Additionally, images shared from other photographers can be imported into the EOS M10, which can then display their settings and even apply them to the scene at hand. By helping the photographer to understand how different settings affect the look and feel of the photo or video, the EOS M10 can be an excellent learning tool. 
Your Stunning Selfie - Everyone wants to look great in photos, and the EOS M10 camera's Self Portrait mode helps make sure your selfie catches you looking incredible. It's accessible in the menu, or via a shortcut button when the touch screen is flipped all the way up. Self Portrait mode can make adjustments ranging from smooth skin tones and background blurring to brightness and more.

The camera allows you to use this mode without a tripod,  and features four sub-modes in addition to Natural - Art Standard, Art  Vivid, Art Bold and Art Embossed which provide striking effects that add  to the creativity of your compositions.
RAW: As with many EOS DSLR cameras, the PowerShot  G7 X camera uses a 12-bit converter to process the output of the CMOS  sensor, resulting in true color, smooth tonal transitions and natural  gradations. The PowerShot G7 X lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records  all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding  flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with  Canon's powerful bundled software. The camera also allows you to record  in RAW and JPEG formats simultaneously. Now, in RAW mode, you can even  select among several aspect ratios, including 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 1:1 and  4:5.
ND Filter: The PowerShot G7 X camera includes a  neutral density (ND) filter. The ND filter reduces light coming into the  sensor, which allows you to set longer exposure times and very wide  apertures to create striking photographic effects.
Creative Shot: The Creative Shot mode featured on  the PowerShot G7 X camera can help anyone create images with artistic  flair. Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes  advantage of Canon's advanced image and scene analysis technology to  apply any of the 46 filter options based on the individual scene,  subject and exposure. In addition to the original shot, the camera  automatically produces and saves five unique variations of the  composition by cropping it, rotating it, or adjusting its color, tone,  and more. The result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for  sharing.

The speed of its continuous-shooting mode is equally impressive and, with up to 12 frames per second at full resolution, makes the V-Lux the perfect choice for sports and wildlife photography.Razor-sharp 4K VideoStill-picture and video camera in one: at the press of a single button, the Leica V-Lux records moving pictures in 4K, the high-definition video format with four times the resolution of full-HD. This means four times the detail and four times the picture quality – that is so excellent that even frames grabbed from video can stand alone as brilliant photos. For moving pictures that become true-to-life memories.Excellent Picture Quality Thanks to a Large SensorEven in unfavorable light and at high ISO settings, the large 1"" sensor of the Leica V-Lux guarantees exceptionally bright and clear pictures – pictures that are rich in detail and fascinate with natural colours. In combination with the high speed of the lens, the sensor expands the creative scope available for the exploration of planes of focus and depth of field and makes the V-Lux the ideal Leica to take along wherever you go.Practical by Nature in Both Design and HandlingThe looks and the first class materials and finish of the new V-Lux are enough to tell that it couldn’t be anything but a Leica. The features of the camera are grasped intuitively. And the change between automatic and manual control couldn’t be easier. This leaves more time to concentrate on the picture that, thanks to the multi-axis rotate-and-tilt function of the 3"" LCD monitor, can be captured with ease at any angle from ground level to a bird’s-eye view. Additional the integrated Wi-Fi module allows remote control from a smartphone or tablet. All you need is the free Leica C Image Shuttle app.Wonderful Outlook with the Integrated ViewfinderThe 2.4 megapixels have a lot to say when it comes to fast and precise judgment of the prefect composition of a subject – even in bright sunlight. The same settings are displayed in the integrated OLED electronic viewfinder of the V-Lux as on its monitor. A big advantage for wearers of glasses: it offers individual diopter compensation.Three-year Warranty InclusiveWith the Leica „Three-year warranty“ - more than many other manufacturer's warranty - the V-Lux delivers more peace of mind. In a warranty case during these 3 years, our worldwide Service & Support team aim to ensure a smooth process and rapid solutions to problems.Professional Image PocessingThe new Leica V-Lux is supplied with the professional still picture and video processing software, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, offering exceptional creative freedom in image manipulation. It optimally ‘develops’ the RAW image files from the CMOS sensor of the V-Lux in the best possible quality. All parameters can be refined in post-processing.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-034773x2000.jpg,,,,,,,

samys-bcd10871e6512e53e6d0021960d720e5,H6X Medium Format Camera with HV 90X-II Viewfinder,USD,7950.00,Hasselblad,,http://schema.org/InStock,"This camera body is designed for use with both film and digital backs featuring an H interface; it supports a variety of interchangeable viewfinders; and is compatible with HC and HCD lenses, as well as C-series lenses when used in conjunction with the CF lens adapter. Versatility comes to the fore again from Hasselblad by offering a camera body that is fully compatible with all H System lenses, including the HCD 24mm, HCD 28mm and the HCD 35-90mm lenses. It can also use the film magazine and offers H5X functionality with 3rd party digital backs. Although aimed primarily at current H1, H2, H2F, H4X and H5X users, the H6X can naturally act as a backup for H5D users too. The Hasselblad H6X Medium Format Camera with HV 90X-II Viewfinder is a medium format SLR camera body specifically designed for use with HC/HCD lenses. The H-system back interface permits working with a wide range of digital backs, and the H 16-32 film magazine to suit a versatile and changing workflow. The H6X also utilizes a single central autofocus point in conjunction with True Focus and Absolute Position Lock technologies to maintain focusing precision while using a focus-then-recompose method of shooting. The H6X sports a durable stainless steel and aluminum alloy body construction, and uses a convenient lithium-ion battery grip to both power the camera as well as provide a comfortable means for handling the camera.The H6X lens program is designed and engineered by Hasselblad to meet the highest optical performance specifications. The HC and HCD lenses cover a wide spectrum of focal lengths and feature the fastest and most precise auto-focus system there is today. The unique HCD 24mm wide-angle lens, the HCD 28mm and the HCD 35-90 zoom lens have been tailored for digital use with a 37 × 49mm sensor, but can of course also be used with larger sensors with a minimal drop in performance in the extreme corners. The integral lens shutters allow for flash sync up to 1/800 second. The lens shutter also provides silent and vibration-free operation. The viewfinder is the most important interface between the photographer and the subject. The large and bright viewfinder of the H6X camera shows the image crisp and clear, letting you work even in dim lighting with perfect results. The HV 90X-II viewfinder covers the full area of the HC lens line and offers near 100% image view and eyesight dioptre correction. The large eyepiece also allows full image view even when wearing glasses. The HVD 90X has been optimized for digital work with the digital sensor size of 37 × 49mm. The HVM, a waist-level viewfinder, is available as an accessory. True Focus helps solve one of the most lingering challenges that faces serious photographers today: true, accurate focusing throughout the image field. Without multi-point autofocus a typical autofocus camera can only correctly measure focus on a subject that is in the centre of the image. When a photographer wants to focus on a subject outside the centre area, they have to lock focus on the subject and then re-compose the image. In short distances especially, this re-composing causes focus error, as the plane of focus sharpness follows the camera's movement, perpendicular to the axis of the lens.Features:

At 24.2 Megapixels, the EOS M5's  sensor delivers images suitable for enlargements with sufficient  resolution for significant trimming. Whether making poster-sized prints,  zooming in on a particular detail or making Full HD movies, the EOS  M5's sensor is primed to deliver. An ISO range of 100-25600 means images  can be captured with low noise and high detail, even in dimly lit  situations. Fast and smooth Dual Pixel CMOS AF helps you capture stills and shoot video with quick and precise autofocus - When the action is happening fast, you and your camera have to be ready  to capture that unforgettable photo - and with the EOS M5 camera,  there's virtually no wait for it to focus, even in low light. Inside,  its Dual Pixel CMOS AF system offers fast and precise autofocus that  stays locked onto your subject, even if your subject is in motion, for  both photos and videos. This advanced Canon technology uses 24.2 million  sensors to quickly determine how far away an object is and therefore  where the lens should focus, and is available while using the electronic  viewfinder and when using Live View on the rear screen. Dual Pixel CMOS  AF helps ensure your images are sharp, while keeping to a minimum the  time it takes to lock focus onto your subject, and smoothly maintaining  focus where you want it. Continuous Shooting at Up to 7.0 fps (Up to 9.0 fps with AF Lock) - To help you get multiple images of a fast-moving subject and ensure you  capture the moment you want, the EOS M5 camera is capable of taking up  to 7.0 frames per second (up to 9.0 fps with AF Lock).

It also  features the new Dual Sensing IS, which uses data from the image itself  to help minimize the blur caused by camera shake and body movement. This  results in clear, sharp pictures even at slow shutter speeds. All this  is in addition to upgraded detail and noise reduction abilities,  especially in low light with high ISO settings. Powerful all around, the  DIGIC 7 Image Processor helps ensure your photos and videos look sharp  and lifelike with minimal unwanted noise or grain. Full HD 60p helps capture fast-moving subjects and brilliant results in MP4 format - Whether you're creating artistic film clips or capturing special  occasions, the advanced video capabilities of the EOS M5 camera can  catch them in the quality they deserve.

Even when you  hold the camera as steady as you can, some unintentional shaking is  possible. To counter this, the EOS M5 camera features 5-axis Digital  Image Stabilization* when recording video. Blur due to movement in the  horizontal and vertical, yaw and pitch (tilting) and roll directions are  all digitally minimized in-camera. For more stabilization, when a  combination IS-compatible lens is attached, the EOS M5 can use the  lens's Optical IS in conjunction with Digital IS for even less chance of  blur due to shaking. These help ensure the videos you record are as  sharp as possible.Built-in high-resolution EVF (approx.  2,360,000 dots) with new Touch and Drag AF lets you manually move the AF  frame displayed for more precise focusing in different shooting  situations - In certain situations, like a bright sunny day, a  viewfinder is preferable to a screen.

For that next level of connectivity, a direct Wi-Fi  connection can be established, letting you use your phone as a  viewfinder, and check and download previously captured photos and  videos. Shorter camera startup time and interval time between each image capture for a more efficient shooting experience - You  don't want to miss that key moment by having to wait for the camera to  turn on. With a quick startup time of approx. 1.0 second, the EOS M5  camera goes from off to able to take a picture almost immediately.

Mechanical dials have given way to buttons, menu systems and LCD displays. But what if we could blend the elegant, simplistic control and styling of classic Nikon film cameras like the F, F3 and FM/FE series with the advanced technology of Nikon's exceptional new D-SLRs? Enter the Nikon Df Digital SLR Camera Body, a thrilling FX-format D-SLR with a unique mechanical operation system and classic styling along with Nikon's flagship digital camera technology. A perfect blend of classic and modern, the Nikon Df offers a more personal shooting style that will inspire a new relationship with your camera—one you may have known and lost over the years—and reawaken your joy for taking photos.Beautiful Photos, Beautifully TakenThe Nikon Df is designed exclusively for taking still photos, enabling high reliability, advanced functions and elegant camera control in our thinnest, lightest FX-format D-SLR.

Its rugged magnesium alloy body will withstand harsh conditions, and its 3.2-inch 921K-dot LCD display provides beautiful high-definition views of your shots.Compatibility Beyond CompareFor over 80 years, NIKKOR lenses have been regarded as some of the finest optics available. In fact, photographers are still using NIKKOR lenses 30 or more years old! The Nikon Df wouldn't be a true classic camera if it couldn't work with those lenses, so we developed a mount system that works with all current AF-S, AF-D and AF NIKKOR lenses. Additionally, a metering coupling lever makes it possible to use both AI (Aperture Index) or non-AI lenses. Use i-TTL compatible Speedlights, the AR-3 threaded cable release, Nikon's new WR Remote System and even Nikon's exciting WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter for instant Wi-Fi photo sharing to your smartphone or tablet!Instantly Share Your Great PhotosAttach the optional WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter and instantly share your beautiful photos.

Stop reaching for your smartphone when an important moment happens except to share the great shot you just caught with the Nikon Df.Focus Exactly Where You Want itWhether you're using the viewfinder with its 100% frame coverage or the LCD display in Live View mode, the Nikon Df captures tack-sharp photos. Its 39-point autofocus system with 9 cross-type sensors quickly locks onto your subject, and Nikon's unique 3D-tracking uses the 2,016-pixel RGB sensor to recognize and follow it across the frame. When shooting with the LCD display in Live View mode, the Nikon Df uses fast contrast-detect AF, operating at the same speed as the flagship D4, and can display your composition at up to 19x for accurate focus confirmation—perfect for tripod shooting.Pictures as Your Eyes See ThemThe Nikon Df features exceptional metering and onboard intelligence, freeing you to focus on the composition of your shots and, most importantly, the moment that's taking place. Nikon's outstanding Scene Recognition System analyzes your shooting situation, compares it to an onboard database of thousands of scenes and automatically determines the most appropriate exposure, white balance and autofocus settings as well as i-TTL flash exposure when using a Nikon Speedlight.Embrace Highlights and ShadowsBuilt-in HDR automatically combines two photos into one highly dynamic image, and new subject-based Active D-Lighting automatically brightens shadowy areas on your subjects—great for portraits.Define Your Own StyleThe Nikon Df's easy to use Picture Controls let you alter your color palette and add a personal touch with six settings available; Standard, Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Portrait and Landscape—customize the look and feel of your photos.Change Your View of the WorldThe Nikon Df is compatible with so many past and present NIKKOR lenses, it's easy to expand your capabilities and creativity over time by growing your own collection.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-028727x1000_1.jpg,,,,,,,

Upper Normandy Revisited - Magnum Photographer Jean Gaumy Returns to his RootsAs a change from travelling through distant countries, globetrotting Magnum photographer Jean Gaumy captured impressions of his native region Upper Normandy – for Leica. With the new Leica M in his luggage, he has created an intensely personal ‘photo diary’ that provides an informal, almost intimate, view of this coastal region and its inhabitants.Leica Max 24 MP Sensor for Maximum Imaging QualityThe Leica M features a completely newly designed high-resolution, 24 megapixel CMOS sensor in full 35 mm format. The combination of the camera’s image processor and this Leica Max 24 MP sensor guarantees outstanding imaging quality. Its intelligent design and flat pixel architecture enables each individual pixel to gather a particularly large amount of light. This results in images characterised by superior sharpness and maximum spatial resolution. The new M delivers extremely low-noise and richly detailed images, even at higher sensitivities of up to ISO 6400. And now, thanks to the 1080 pixel, full-HD video capability of the Leica M, the impressive imaging quality is available for moving pictures, too.The new CMOS sensor is designed and constructed for the use of both Leica M and R lenses on the Leica M. Because, with the new Leica R-Adapter M, almost all Leica-R legacy lenses can be used on the Leica M expanding the options of the Leica M into the world of Leica R photography. Fast Leica Maestro Image ProcessorIn conjunction with the new sensor, the Leica Maestro processor lets the Leica M set entirely new standards in terms of image-processing speed. It processes the image data arriving from the sensor and transforms them into visible images at extremely high speeds and can also perform even the most complex processing steps very fast. Thanks to the energy-efficient imaging electronics of the processor and sensor, a single charge of the Leica M’s new 1800 mAh lithium-ion battery can last an extremely long time.Universal Capabilities with Live View and the Electronic ViewfinderThe new Leica M is the first ever M to feature Live View and Live View Focusing. This means that now, for the first time, images can be composed using the actual image produced by the lens – with complete control of depth of field, exposure, precise framing and focusing. Its large, high-resolution 3"" monitor allows precise assessment of the subject seen through the lens. This opens up entirely new opportunities for M-Photographers that previously lay far beyond the limitations of rangefinder photography, like macro and telephoto exposures, or using the monitor as a viewfinder.Live View can be used with both M and R lenses. Indirectly, it also enables owners of R lenses to use the optional Visoflex EVF2 electronic viewfinder. The Leica M can be used with an R-Adapter, R-Lenses and a viewfinder exactly like an SLR, without using the monitor.Splash-proof Camera BodyThanks to the many years of experience gathered by our engineers in the construction of camera bodies, the new Leica M is built without compromise for maximum stability and perfect sealing. Its top and base plates are machined from solid brass, and its full-metal body is manufactured in one piece from high-strength magnesium alloy. Specially designed rubber seals protect the camera body against dust and water spray. The glass covering plate of its high-resolution monitor screen is manufactured from particularly tough and scratch-resistant Corning® Gorilla® glass. All this makes the Leica M particularly resilient and helps guarantee it a long and reliable working life.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-020977x600.jpg,,,,,,,

Stable viewfinder image - You can monitor the stabilizing effects of camera shake compensation in the viewfinder or LCD screen while shooting still images by pressing the shutter button halfway or magnifying the image, and while shooting movies by entering movie mode. Even when using a telephoto or macro lens, you can fine-tune framing and focusing without stress for steady results.
S-Log Gamma setting - This proprietary Sony setting featured in professional camcorders creates a 1300% wider dynamic range for smooth gradation with reduced whiteout and blackout. Use color grading in post-production to make the most of low-noise images and super-rich detail to express footage in various ways. ISO 800 or higher is available when S-Log Gamma is selected.
Picture Profile - Fine-tune the look of movies before shooting by adjusting gradation, color adjustment and detail. Adjusted parameters can be saved with other settings as a profile, and up to 7 profiles (PP1-PP7) can be stored for later recall.
Clean HDMI output - This function supports 4K and Full HD and allows uncompressed movie output to an external recorder or monitor. The image can also be recorded in the camera10 even while signals are output using this function. The included cable protector guards jacks and prevents cables from disengaging accidentally, so you can shoot with greater assurance.
Bright Monitoring - This function that boosts image brightness by changing shutter speed, for example, can be assigned to a customizable button for easy access when shooting a starry sky or other dark scene.
More precise white balance adjustment - The a7R II offers more white balance adjustment steps (twice as many on the amber-blue axis; four times as many on the green-magenta axis) than before, so you can finely tune white balance with more subtle precision for more natural colors.
1200-zone Evaluative Metering - Ample data from 1200-zone metering and focal plane phase-detection AF points allows for more precise control of light volume from an external flash that complements ambient light. Choose Multi-segment, Center-weighted or Spot-metering mode.
Priority setup in AF-C/AF-S - In AF-S (Single-shot AF) or AF-C (Continuous AF) mode, choose AF priority for taking pictures only when subject is in focus, Release priority for taking pictures even when subject is not in focus, or Balanced Emphasis for balancing the AF and Release options to achieve accurate focus, yet not miss a decisive moment when shooting moving subjects.
ISO Auto Minimum Shutter Speed - Prevent blur in a shot of a moving subject by setting a shutter speed at which ISO sensitivity starts changing when ISO AUTO (while in P or A mode, or in Multi Frame NR) is selected.
Creative Style - Creative Style settings bring out the character of your scene. Simply select any of 13 settings (Vivid, Portrait, etc.) and the camera will adjust image parameters. You can also fine-tune contrast, saturation11 and sharpness to suit your preference.
Auto HDR (High Dynamic Range) - Auto HDR composites the best details from three exposures to expand the dynamic range of your images from darkest shadows to brightest highlights and capture all the tonal gradations seen by your naked eye.
AF-A mode - In this mode, press the shutter button halfway down, and the camera automatically recognizes whether the subject is moving or not, then switches AF mode accordingly between AF-S to lock on a subject in focus and AF-C to keep adjusting focus. This versatility is useful for shooting various subjects at the same time, or to avoid switching AF mode manually.
Multi Frame NR (Noise Reduction) - This mode composites four shots to significantly suppress noise and raise sensitivity, letting you clearly capture dark scenes without a tripod or flash. Camera shake blur is also lowered while contrast and detail are raised.

Perfect for travel and nature photography, the built-in GPS allows location data to be recorded while shooting. Compact, lightweight, brilliant low-light performance, and loaded with easy to use features, the EOS 6D is truly the Full-Frame DSLR camera for everyone.The 20.2MP full-frame sensor pairs with the DIGIC 5+ image processor to realize notable sensitivity to an expanded ISO 102400, a continuous shooting rate of 4.5 fps, and full HD 1080p video recording. An apt 11-point AF system incorporates a center cross-type focus point for heightened low-light accuracy and an iFCL 63-zone dual-layer metering sensor ensures consistent exposure values regardless of lighting conditions. Complementing the imaging versatility of the 6D is the wide-angle to short telephoto EF 24-105mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens, which incorporates a near-silent stepping AF motor, image stabilization, and a refined optical design that pairs well with the full-frame image sensor. Benefitting the imaging capabilities of the 6D is built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, which enables seamlessly sharing imagery to mobile devices as well as remote control and live view monitoring from smartphones or tablets. Additionally, the 6D also incorporates a GPS receiver into its design, which records location data with each exposure to track where your images were recorded and to view the exact route your shooting takes you. The 6D's handling attributes further benefit from a slim profile and a durable aluminum alloy and polycarbonate chassis, along with a large 3.0"" 1.04m-dot LCD for bright and clear live view and image playback.Features: 

20.2 Megapixel Full-Frame CMOS Sensor: The large full-frame 20.2 megapixel CMOS sensor offers a high level of image quality with attention given to sharpness, detail, and depiction of colors and tones within a scene. Due to increased information and detail, a larger sensor is capable of producing greater visual depth and smoother gradients and tonal transitions. Additionally, a large sensor provides more leeway to control the plane of focus and apply selective focus techniques. This sensor delivers images with a maximum resolution of 5472 x 3648 pixels, with a pixel size of 6.55 µm square, for greater reception of light and a lower signal-to-noise ratio. This pixel structure works in close collaboration with the DIGIC 5+ image processor, and its 14-bit A/D conversion, to produce a native sensitivity range of ISO 100-25600, which can be further expanded to ISO 50-102400. In addition to contributing to the low-light sensitivity, the DIGIC 5+ processor also delivers overall speed and power to the 6D and utilizes dual 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits for expedited conversion of both JPEG and RAW file formats. This enables a maximum continuous shooting rate of 4.5 full resolution frames-per-second as well as greater noise reduction when working at higher ISOs. The DIGIC 5+ processor also provides real-time compensation for chromatic aberration when working with both still and moving imagery.
11-Point Autofocus System: The 6D integrates an 11-point AF system for fast and precise focusing regardless of your subject matter or working situation. These 11 points provide even coverage across the entire frame while a more refined center cross-type point with EV -3 sensitivity provides more efficient, accurate low-light focusing. One-shot AF, AI Servo AF, and AI Focus AF are all available depending on one's needs, and furthermore the AI Servo mode is customizable in regard to focus tracking, acceleration, and deceleration sensitivities, as well as 1st or 2nd image priority adjustments. Lens data can also be entered and customized within the camera for greater focus refinement when working with wide-angle or telephoto lenses. Also contributing to sharp focus, the 6D incorporates a large, bright pentaprism viewfinder with 21mm eye point and 97% frame coverage for clear viewing of the scene. This construction greatly benefits the manual focusing capabilities, as well as general low-light composition.
iFCL 63-Zone Dual Layer Metering Sensor: An intelligent metering system works in conjunction with the autofocus system and independently analyzes focus, color, and luminance within the scene for the most precise exposure settings possible. The 63 zones cover the entire image area with great detail and the dual-layer design permits a wider sensitivity to different wavelengths of light. The dual layers are split into a red/green channel and a blue/green channel; which counters the red light sensitivity bias electronic sensors inherently have. A series of algorithms are employed to combine data received from both layers, with the resulting exposure reading being extremely accurate regardless of the shooting conditions. This metering system employs evaluative, center-weighted, and spot metering methods to determine exposure, as well as allowing for a +/- 5 EV exposure compensation for greater manipulation of the determined exposure setting.
EOS HD Video: Full HD video recording is supported in multiple formats, including 1080/30p, 24p, 25p; 720/60p, 50p; 480/60p, 50p. While recording video, a 4GB automatic file partition is employed in order to gain longer continuous recording times, up to 29 minutes 59 seconds. Both All I-frame (requires UHS-I memory card) and IPB compressions are supported as well as the standard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec. Embedding the time code is also possible for greater convenience when recording with multiple cameras. Video performance is further enhanced with the ability to manually adjust your exposure settings and audio levels; exposure can be adjusted using both aperture and shutter speed variables, and sound can be managed through a 64-level volume control. Additionally, an external stereo microphone can be used and is connected through the 3.5mm microphone terminal. The DIGIC 5+ processor also dramatically improves video response times and helps to reduce color artifacts, aberrations, and moiré while providing the ability to record with sensitivities up to ISO 25600 in H mode.
EF 24-105mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens: Included with the camera body is a wide-angle to short telephoto zoom lens that is characterized by its STM autofocus motor, which benefits both still and video recording with its quick, near-silent, and smooth focusing performance. Furthermore, the lens sees the inclusion of an Optical Image Stabilizer, which helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake by four shutter speed stops to better enable working in difficult lighting conditions. Two aspherical elements and one UD (Ultra-Low Dispersion) element are incorporated within the lens design to reduce chromatic aberrations and various distortions throughout the zoom range, and optimized lens coatings have also been applied to control lens flare and ghosting for maintained contrast and clarity.
Built-In Wi-Fi and GPS: Built-in Wi-Fi and GPS technologies enable highly functional connectivity with other devices, including the ability to instantly share imagery from your camera and geotag your photographs. Exposure settings can be controlled remotely from your smartphone when using Canon's proprietary iOS and Android app, Canon EOS Remote, allowing you to make exposures and modify camera settings from a distance. You can also review imagery from your camera on your smart device, and transfer files wirelessly. Full DNLA (Digital Living Network Alliance) compatibility is supported, which enables you to share your images from the 6D with other household products such as HDTVs, tablets, and other Wi-Fi-enabled Canon cameras. You are also able to upload still images directly to CANON iMAGE GATEWAY, allowing you to then easily share images with social networking sites without the use of a computer. The GPS receiver functions similarly and is able to record locational data (longitude, latitude, altitude, and universal coordinated time) as EXIF data which is then embed into your image files. This then permits you to track where your images were recorded and view your exact route traveled.
Efficient Design: The EOS 6D contains a large full-frame sensor within a compactly-sized body for greater portability without sacrificing image quality. The body features an aluminum alloy and polycarbonate chassis with magnesium polycarbonate resin exterior for durability, as well as a shutter rated up to 100,000 cycles. Also contributing to the efficiency of design, an Integrated Cleaning System permits internal dust removal. To counter the effects of dust within the housing, the glass filter is cleaned through ultrasonic vibration and the dust particles are collected by an adsorbent. This unit is completely sealed from external contaminants, and the optical low-pass filter features an anti-dust fluorine coating for ease in removing more substantial dust particles.
3.0"" Clear View LCD Monitor: The 3.0"" Clear View TFT LCD provides high quality viewing with a 1,040,000-dot resolution and anti-reflection coating. This allows for sharp and clear viewing in even the brightest of conditions and displays images and videos with great detail and richness. The display also features a viewing angle up to 160° for review from the side or below. When used in conjunction with Live View mode, a smaller display is placed over the image. Live View mode permits real-time image review and can also place grid lines over the image for compositional help. A built-in electronic level is available for maintaining consistent horizons or for lining up parallel lines within a scene. You can also zoom into and navigate within the image when in Live View and use the grid lines for minute control and precision over the alignment of your photograph.
Built-In HDR and Multiple Exposure Modes: A High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is available and allows for the creation of HDR images in-camera, reducing the time needed to manually overlay images in post-production. When using this mode, a series of bracketed exposures are made of the same image, then automatically integrated into the same frame, resulting in a photograph without blown highlights or blocked up shadows and a long middle range of tones. This mode is especially useful when photographing scenes with a great deal of contrast. Multiple exposures are also possible in-camera and up to 9 exposures can be recorded onto a single file using 2 distinct settings for control. When in Additive mode, this closely resembles making multiple exposures on film and layers each exposure; manual exposure compensation is required. Average mode layers the images and automatically compensates for the final exposure, eliminating the unintended possibility of gross under or overexposure. Multiple exposures can be recorded in either JPEG or RAW formats, and furthermore you can utilize an existing RAW image as a starting point from which to layer subsequent images onto, which can then be manipulated in real time on the LCD.
Scene Intelligent Auto and Special Scene modes: Scene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon's automatic exposure technology together in order to output a well-refined exposure. Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure are all employed to intelligently analyze the scene at hand and produce the most effective exposure settings to clearly render your subject matter. Special Scene modes also help to enhance your imagery by applying a system of corrections for use in more difficult lighting situations. Handheld Night Scene automatically captures four consecutive exposures, at shutter speeds fast enough to handhold, and layers them into a single frame. This allows you to effectively record images in darker situations without the need of a tripod or stabilization device. HDR Backlight Control works in the same manner and records a series of exposures at different values to ensure highlight and shadow values are not lost. These under and over-exposed images are blended to create a final image with a wider dynamic range.
Compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC, including Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards.
Peripheral illumination, chromatic aberration, and distortion corrections are available and programmable through a menu of different available EF lenses. This lens data is used to automatically correct for each individual lens' traits to produce the cleanest image possible.
In-camera RAW processing and JPEG resizing are available to allow for expedited offloading of imagery that is instantly reading for the method in which you intend to share it.
Comparative playback allows you to view two images side-by-side in order to expedite editing procedures on the camera's LCD
Silent shooting is a low-vibration shooting mode that slows and mutes the shutter and mirror reflex, enabling a more discrete method of capturing imagery.

In order to tackle this problem, Canon developed the High Dynamic Range shooting mode to make shooting even more intuitive. Under High Dynamic Range the camera will shoot three different exposures in succession (underexposed, overexposed and normal) and then merge them into a single image. Underexposed areas are combined with the overexposed and vice versa, resulting in an evenly detailed image with flattering shadows and highlights. The PowerShot G1 X Mark II allows you to use this mode without a tripod and features four sub-modes in addition to Natural – Art Standard, Art Vivid, Art Bold and Art Embossed – which provide striking effects that add to the creativity of your compositions.",http://www.Samys.com/images/product/main/S-030696x1000.jpg,,,,,,,

With the D500 at your side, whether you're hiking through the lush landscapes of New Zealand or on safari in Africa, it will be ready to go, effortless and unobtrusive.
Unleash the full potential of the D500 - Like every Nikon DSLR, the D500 is best paired with legendary NIKKOR lenses which provide unequalled clarity and versatility. The NIKKOR legacy is unmatched--there's a reason over 95 million have been sold to date. Each lens offers a different view from which to capture your memories. Shooting landscapes or portraiture? The fast AF-S DX NIKKOR 16-80mm f/2.8-4E ED VR could prove to be your best friend.

With such a buffer size, the new Leica M-P is ready to shoot at almost anytime, thus, the ‘decisive moment’ is never missed. With the reduced, classic look, without the Leica logo, the Leica M-P has an unobtrusive appearance making it a professional tool with a unique identity. The sapphire glass is extremely scratch resistant and unbreakable, an appealing feature to professional photographers. Leica Camera is the only manufacturer that offers sapphire glass as a camera display protection. The Leica M-P has the classic image field selector which is another appealing feature to professional photographers and avid Leica M users.Features: 

Scratch resistant display-cover made of sapphire glass
Long-lasting readiness to capture due to a large double sized image buffer of 2 GB
Pure look without the Leica Logo and “M” lettering on the front side
Manual viewfinder frame selection with the traditional ‘frame selector‘

Always Ready to Capture the Decisive MomentThe Leica M-P features a 2 GB memory buffer. This makes it twice as fast at capturing shots in sequence than the Leica M.Exceptionally ResilientExtremely scratch resistant sapphire crystal glass is used for the protective cover of the LCD monitor screen of the Leica M-P. This is one of the world’s hardest materials and is almost unbreakable. An anti-reflective coating on both sides of the monitor cover glass also improves image reviewing, even in unfavorable light.Noticeably UnnoticeableThe Leica M-P enables authentic images to be captured from the heart of life itself. Its compact size, minimalist design and almost silent shutter make it the ideal companion for unobtrusive photography. For this, even the Leica logo was omitted. Instead, the top plate of the Leica M-P is graced only by a classical Leica script.Maximum Image QualityExceptional image sharpness and the finest rendition of details. The Leica M-P is equipped with a 24 megapixel, high-resolution, full-frame (24x36 mm), CMOS sensor – the Leica MAX 24 MP. In combination with the high-performance Leica Maestro image processor, this ensures outstanding pictures with every exposure. A further benefit is extremely low image noise – a factor that makes the Leica M-P ideal for available light photography.Sharp Pictures GuaranteedThe classic rangefinder (a combined viewfinder and rangefinder) enables fast and accurate focusing with absolute precision. Two additional focusing methods provide even more creative opportunities. ‘Live View Zoom’ offers 10-fold magnification of the Live View display and ‘Live View focus peaking’ can automatically highlight sharply-focused contours in a choice of red, green or blue. This range of options means that you always have focusing effortlessly under complete control.Moving Pictures with the Leica LookThe unique imaging qualities of Leica lenses are naturally also available for the 1080p, full-HD video recording capability of the Leica M-P. Perfect exposure control and recording settings allow photographers to complement their still pictures with professional video recordings – with the typical, premium quality look that is a hallmark of Leica photography.Universal OptionsLive View is a common feature of both the Leica M-P and the Leica M. It allows subjects and scenes to be composed through the lens – with full control of depth of field, exposure, framing and sharpness. The large, high-resolution 3"" monitor screen (920,000 pixels) of the Leica M-P is ideal for the precise assessment of sharpness, exposure and the colours of a subject. Like many of its legendary M ancestors, the Leica M-P, has a frame selector to aid the photographer in the choice of the optimum focal length for a subject or scene.For Long ShootsThe rechargeable lithium-ion battery (1800 mAh) of the Leica M-P offers impressive performance and high capacity for shooting for long periods between charges. This ensures constant readiness for longer shooting sessions. A single full charge is sufficient for a multitude of exposures and guarantees that the M-P will never let you down, even in remote locations.Ergonomic HandlingIn the Leica M-P, the traditional, highly-regarded exposure functions of the M-System are united with cutting edge ergonomic design. Thanks to an easily accessible thumb wheel on the top plate, intuitive menu navigation and a user-friendly menu interface for the monitor screen on the back of the camera, photographers can concentrate on the essential – their pictures.Photography in Any WeatherIt is not uncommon that our cameras last a lifetime. Thanks to body components machined from solid brass, a full-metal, magnesium alloy chassis and a sapphire crystal screen protector, the body and monitor screen effortlessly resist the issues of everyday photography. Specially designed rubber seals protect the camera body against splashes, moisture, dust and inclement weather conditions.Faster ResultsThe high image data processing speed achieved by the combination of the Leica MAX 24 MP sensor with the Leica Maestro image processor is astonishing. Thanks to short buffering times and a particularly large, two gigabyte memory, exposures can be captured in rapid sequences without missing a shot.

From overseas vacations to  backyard family gatherings, the EOS M10's compact size means it can  easily be on hand, without getting in the way. A built-in thumb grip  also lets you grasp the body securely, while the rounded edges make  holding the camera easier when recording long video clips. All this  while still featuring the image quality for which Canon EOS cameras are  so well known.
18.0 Megapixel Sensor - The 18.0 Megapixel CMOS  sensor captures lots of detail with very little image noise. The sensor  itself is APS-C type, which is the same size as the sensor found in  Canon's EOS Rebel series of cameras. The high resolution means you can  crop the image to focus on one section, or have enough detail to print  large photos to display or give to your family and friends. An ISO range  of 100–12800 (expandable to 25600) lets you capture images on bright  sunny beaches and darkened streets.
DIGIC 6 Image Processor - Complementing the EOS  M10's camera's CMOS sensor, Canon's DIGIC 6 Image Processor not only  speeds up camera operations, but also helps enhance a number of the  camera's advanced features. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor aids the  camera's sensor in capturing detailed images with reduced noise at high  ISOs and enables high-quality movie capture with a number of different  movie compressions including MP4. On top of that, it enhances the  camera's Dynamic Image Stabilization system and even helps improve the  AF system's face detection accuracy.
Fast Focus - Life happens fast, and there's little  worse than missing out on capturing that perfect moment because the  camera was too slow to focus. The EOS M10 camera uses Canon's Hybrid  CMOS AF II autofocus system, which measures up to 49 different points in  an image quickly and accurately to help get it in focus. In addition,  face detection and object tracking help keep the subject of your photo  focused, even if they move.

Full HD Videos at 24p and 30p in MP4 Format - The  EOS M10 camera can capture 1920x1080 Full HD video at frame rates of  both 24p and 30p, and can record in MP4 format for easy sharing online.
Moviemaking Made Easy with Manual Movie Control - The EOS M10 camera is a fine moviemaking tool. With touch-activated AF  and a number of manual controls available, it's easy to make intuitive  setting adjustments silently and on the fly using the EOS M10's dials  and touch operations.
Creative Photographic Options - With its built-in  Creative Assist feature, the EOS M10 camera makes it simple to change  camera settings in real time and see the effects as they happen. Whether  adjusting brightness, sharpness, contrast, color tone and intensity or  even moving to monochromatic images, the EOS M10 makes it easy for  novices and professionals alike to find just the right look to match the  emotion or tone of the image. Up to six personal settings can be saved  and applied anytime when composing other images. Additionally, images  shared from other photographers can be imported into the EOS M10, which  can then display their settings and even apply them to the scene at  hand. By helping the photographer to understand how different settings  affect the look and feel of the photo or video, the EOS M10 can be an  excellent learning tool. 
Your Stunning Selfie - Everyone wants to look great  in photos, and the EOS M10 camera's Self Portrait mode helps make sure  your selfie catches you looking incredible. It's accessible in the menu,  or via a shortcut button when the touch screen is flipped all the way  up. Self Portrait mode can make adjustments ranging from smooth skin  tones and background blurring to brightness and more.

Easy-to-use Built-in Flash - Sometimes a scene is  just too dark for a camera to capture. The compact and powerful built-in  flash pops up when needed, and snaps back into the body when it isn't.  It's a quick burst of light to help capture a last photo of your friends  before everyone heads home for the night.

The DIGIC 7 Image Processor immediately pays dividends with  improved auto focus tracking, enhanced IS and superb image clarity even  when shooting with a high ISO. For increased flexibility, the PowerShot  G7 X Mark II offers high-speed continuous shooting up to 8 fps in RAW,  JPEG and RAW+JPEG modes, and is equipped with Full HD capability,  built-in Wi-Fi and NFC and in-camera RAW conversion, giving you  everything you need to capture inspiring images and video and share them  with ease.FEATURES:1.0-inch, 20.1 Megapixel CMOS Sensor - The PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera features a large 1.0-inch, 20.1  Megapixel CMOS sensor that helps capture high-quality images and videos.  Its wide dynamic range helps ensure both bright and dark parts of an  image are fully captured, like the shadowy side of a building on a  bright sunny day, or streetlights on a dark night. 20.1 Megapixels*  means photos with enough detail to print, or enjoy on high-resolution  monitors and mobile devices. It also gives additional flexibility during  editing, giving you the option of cropping in on your subject for  improved composition while still having a detailed, high-resolution  image. Smooth gradations from light to dark keeps unrealistic banding in  solid colors to a minimum. Thanks to an available ISO of up to 12800  (expandable to 25600) and the power of the new DIGIC 7 Image Processor,  extremely low-light photos and videos are possible, with minimal image  noise. Using a high ISO also allows for a faster shutter speed, which  lowers the possibility of blur caused by excessive hand-held camera  shake. For added flexibility, both JPEG and RAW images can be captured  and saved.DIGIC 7 Image Processor - The DIGIC 7  Image Processor’s enhanced tracking and detection capabilities help  keep subjects in focus, while ensuring each image has a high level of  sharpness and minimum picture noise. Whether you’re capturing a  fast-moving athlete or a feisty puppy, the DIGIC 7 Image Processor in  the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera can stay locked on throughout the  action. Improved face tracking helps keep your friend or family member  the subject of the photo. Even in extreme cases, like in low saturation  or low-light dusk, dawn or darkened interior moments, the DIGIC 7 Image  Processor helps keep what you’re photographing in focus. It also  features the new Dual Sensing IS, which uses data from the image itself  to help minimize the blur caused by camera shake and body movement. This  results in clear, precise pictures even at slow shutter speeds. All  this is in addition to upgraded detail and noise reduction abilities,  especially in low light with high ISO settings. Powerful all around, the  DIGIC 7 Image Processor helps ensure your photos and videos look sharp  and lifelike with minimal unwanted noise or grain.Canon HS System - The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen.  Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly  impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the  result of two technologies in the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera: the  large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more  light; and the DIGIC 7 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at  high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at  full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds  in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with outstanding  clarity and detail.4.2x, f/1.8 (W) – f/2.8 (T) Optical Zoom Lens (24–100mm) - The remarkable lens on the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera takes full  advantage of the camera's large sensor, giving your photography a wide  range of expression. With a bright aperture value of f/1.8 at the wide  angle and f/2.8 when fully zoomed to a factor of 4.2x (24–100mm), this  lens not only puts more in your frame, but is equipped to capture an  incredible variety of situations with artistry and precision. Equipped  with a 9-blade iris diaphragm, the lens lets you achieve a beautiful  background defocus with shapes that are nearly round. Capture macro  shots from as close as 2.0 in. (telephoto at 1.3 ft.). From a design  perspective, each of the 11 glass lenses on the PowerShot G7 X Mark II  has a multi-layer coating on it, which is similar to the Super Spectra  Coating technology developed by Canon for EF lenses. These coatings have  features like a high transmission factor, ultraviolet protection,  resistant surface hardness, and stable characteristics. The coating also  maximizes suppression of unwanted reflected light from ghosting or  flaring to deliver clear images with high image quality.Intelligent IS - Equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS, the PowerShot G7 X  Mark II camera helps you capture clear, steady images – even in low  light without using a tripod. The system automatically analyzes camera  movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting  situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot.

When shooting video, the system selects  from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS  modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're  shooting still images or video.Capture impressively  high-resolution images with high-speed continuous shooting up to 8 fps  in RAW mode, JPEG mode and RAW+JPEG mode - When the action  happens fast, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera can move fast with it.  With the ability to shoot continuously at up to 8 fps, it can help you  capture incredible images with nearly no time wasted. Whether you’re  trying to catch the moment a player hits the ball, a bird taking flight  or the start of any special moment, you can be sure you can capture the  photo you want. Offering the flexibility to suit your specific needs,  the PowerShot G7 X Mark II can shoot continuously in RAW mode*, JPEG  mode and RAW+JPEG mode*.

By simply tapping  with NFC, photos and videos are wirelessly transferred to the Connect  Station, where up to 1TB of hard drive space and simple menus make them  easy to store, manage and sort by albums, date or device name. From  there, images and videos can be viewed in Full HD on an HDTV (via an  HDMI cable), sent to compatible wireless printers,  viewed/uploaded/downloaded from smartphones and tablets or PCs, and  shared with other Canon Connect Stations and on social networking sites.Picture Style function allows superb command of in-camera color, contrast and sharpness - The Picture Style function, just like on EOS series digital cameras,  lets you choose between eight presets that adjust color, contrast and  other aspects of the image to help you fine-tune how your picture looks.  For example, if you’re taking a photo of a friend, you can use Portrait  mode, which keeps the subject in focus while artistically blurring the  background for a soft feel. If you’re looking to capture some stunning  mountain peaks, you can use Landscape mode, which helps ensure the image  is in focus and the colors are vibrant. There are eight styles to  choose from, plus you can download additional styles and even create  your own with the Picture Style Editor.In-camera RAW  conversion makes it possible to preview modified conditions of images on  the camera, without the use of a computer - The PowerShot G7 X  Mark II camera’s powerful in-camera RAW conversion lets you adjust  multiple aspects of an image after you capture it, without using a  computer. If an image is a little darker than you’d hoped, you can  increase the brightness, or let the Auto Light Optimizer analyze the  photo and change the levels accordingly. You can also fine-tune the  white balance for a cool or warm look, change the Picture Style and  more. When you’re satisfied with the results, switch between the  original and adjusted image to check your work, then save the result as a  JPEG for later use.Control ring features a convenient  selection lever enabling you to quickly switch between step ring and  continuous ring movement - The versatile control ring is a  quick and convenient way to manually adjust photos and navigate camera  menus. A selection lever lets you switch between step ring and  continuous ring movement. Step ring movement makes changing settings,  like switching between Picture Styles, tweaking aperture or modifying  shutter speeds, fast and easy. Continuous ring movement lets you  smoothly change focus with minimal sound, even while recording movies,  so you’re able to decide what part of the image is sharp while on the  go.Time-Lapse Movie helps capture images at set intervals and combines them to create a short movie clip of the footage - Time-Lapse Movie mode captures an image every few seconds, then  combines these multiple images into a single movie. The sun dropping  over the horizon, boats navigating a harbor, cars twisting through  streets during rush hour can all be compressed in time, while  maintaining gorgeous image quality. Movement appears fast, like reality  has been accelerated. Intervals of 1- to 30-seconds between photos are  available.Panning allows the camera to lock onto the  main subject using IS and automatically adjust the shutter speed for  beautiful background blur - By using a slow shutter speed and  Canon’s advanced image stabilization, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II  camera’s Panning mode can help you capture fast-moving subjects in an  artistic and striking fashion. Athletes, cars, trains and more can be  kept in focus while the background is smoothly blurred, creating an  intense appearance of motion.Canon Connect Station CS100:The Canon Connect Station CS100 is your go-to photo and video hub that lets you share, store, view and manage your most memorable moments.

It may have no monitor, no exposure meter, and no battery, but what it does have is a mechanical quality that makes Leica’s 100 years of experience instantly tangible. Photographers can read the shutter speed and aperture directly from the camera and lens and so concentrate fully on their subject. The acoustic signature of the shutter release of a Leica M-A is a delight that immediately reveals the precision-engineered excellence of its origin.The exterior of the Leica M-A is as timeless as the precision engineering hidden inside. For instance, the Leica red dot has been deliberately omitted to emphasise the classic restraint of its design as an ultimate expression of understatement. Viewed from the side, the M-A is also noticeably slimmer than its digital counterparts.The camera is available in black finishe: In the black chrome option, the M-A is reminiscent of the style of the M Monochrom and raises the bar in terms of unobtrusiveness and discretion. While an engraving on the top plate of the silver chrome M-A indicates its origins, only a closer look at its black-coloured counterpart reveals the Leica logo on its accessory shoe.The M-System is not the only photographic legend celebrating its 60th birthday in 2014. Kodak Tri-X 400 film was also brought to life in 1954. With its exceptional sharpness, fine grain, and distinctive tonal gradation, extremely broad exposure latitude, and very good shadow detail, this black and white film soon became a firm favorite and a classic for art and reportage photography. And it’s also the perfect partner for the Leica M-A – which explains why Kodak Tri-X 400 film is included in the Leica M-A package.Features:
