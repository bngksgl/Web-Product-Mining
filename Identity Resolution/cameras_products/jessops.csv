The ISO can be extended to an amazing 50 to 204800 (stills) and the new battery  allows shooting of up to approximately 710 photos. 4K video is also included along with improved Fast Hybrid AF for movie recording.





Back-illuminated 24.2MP full-frame sensor
The 35mm full-frame Exmor Râ¢ CMOS image sensor features 24.2-megapixel resolution, back illumination, and gapless on-chip lens design for extraordinary sensitivity and dynamic range. Two times faster data readout speed is achieved through copper wires and front-end LSI.


Enhanced image processing system
A combination of new-generation image processing system and a new sensor achieves an up to 1.5-stop improvement12 in image quality. A wide ISO sensitivity range of up to ISO 51200 is standard, and approx. up to 15-stop13 dynamic range at low sensitivity settings is realised. Upgraded Detail Reproduction and Area-specific Noise Reduction join to suppress noise and maintain a sense of high overall resolution. Colour reproduction, especially of skin and nature scenes, has also been dramatically improved. The Î±7 III also supports 14-bit RAW output even during silent shooting/continuous shooting.


Wider, faster AF performance
An evolved image processing system and Î±9 camera AF algorithms optimised for the Î±7 III improve AF speed, precision, and tracking performance. 693 phase-detection AF points and 425 contrast-detection AF points provide high-density wide-area coverage. AF speed improved by up to twice and more precise AF tracking performance let you capture and maintain focus on a quickly moving subject in unpredictable motion. The Î±7 III also autofocuses reliably down to EV-3 brightness.


New AF-ON button and multi-selector
The new AF-ON button activates autofocus without any half-press-shutter-button focus sequence, so you can concentrate better on exactly when to release the shutter and capture the moment instantly. A multi-selector lets you shift the point of focus quickly and efficiently. You can select and shift the point of focus intuitively, so you wonât miss great chances to shoot moving subjects.


Eye AF now supporting AF-C
Eye AF newly supports AF-C mode with greater precision that dramatically enhances portrait shooting, plus higher AF speed that makes it easier to shoot a portrait of a moving subject, even if the subject looks down and away from the camera, or is backlit with face in partial darkness. The Î±7 III supports Eye AF for A-mount lenses mounted via an adaptor.


Comprehensive AF
AF tracking sensitivity when shooting stills is adjustable in five steps for subjects that move outside of the focus area. Autofocus areas and points remain the same or change when switching between horizontal and vertical orientations, depending on the shooting situation. AF area registration allows frequently used focus point settings to be memorised and assigned to custom buttons for fast, convenient recall at a touch whenever needed.


Up to 10 fps with AF/AE tracking
With new shutter charge unit and image processing system refinements, the Î±7 III can shoot continuously at up to 10 fps with AF/AE tracking (up to 8 fps with minimal display lag in live-view continuous shooting mode) for easy, stable shooting of even intensely active subjects. Up to approximately 177 JPEG images (standard) in full resolution, 89 compressed RAW images, or 40 uncompressed RAW images can be captured in one continuous burst. An electronic shutter allows silent, vibration-free shooting of wildlife and other sensitive situations when even slight noise can mean missing an ideal shot.


Anti-flicker shooting
Flicker from fluorescent and other artificial lighting is automatically detected and shutter action is timed to minimise the flickerâs effect on still images. This suppresses exposure and colour anomalies at the top and bottom of images shot at high shutter speeds, as well as exposure and colour inconsistency between continuous shots, so you can take images indoors with more confidence.


4K movies
High-resolution full-frame 4K movies24 with full-pixel readout without pixel binning that condenses approximately 2.4 times the amount of data required for 4K movies (QFHD: 3840 x 2160) results in minimal moirÃ© and jaggies. Advanced image processing makes it possible to record full-frame 4K movies with outstanding image quality in the mid-to-high ISO range, so you make the most of the 4K movie formatâs unique potential in every shot. Super 35mm can also be selected, instead of full-frame mode, as needed.


Versatile movie recording functions
The Î±7 III provides a wide array of functions to facilitate workflows of professional videographers, including clean HDMI output, time code / user bits (TC/UB), rec. control, marker display/setting, zebra function, Slow and Quick Motion, simultaneous proxy movie recording, extraction and separate storage of a still from a movie, and Gamma Display Assist function, among others.


Fast Hybrid AF for movie recording
An efficient combination of focal-plane phase-detection AF and contrast-detection AF accurately locks onto even fast-moving subjects, then tracks them smoothly during movie recording. AF coverage for movies extends across an area almost as wide as the AF coverage area for still images, so once the high-density AF system locks onto a movie subject, the camera continues to track it steadily and tenaciously. Three AF drive speed settings give you freedom to use slow focus effects when shooting movie scenes.


In-body 5-axis image stabilisation with 5.0-stop shutter speed
This comprehensive system compensates for five types of camera shake that tend to blur images: pitch/yaw shake when shooting at longer focal lengths; X/Y shake in close-up (including macro) shooting; and roll shake when recording stills at night and movies. It effectively achieves 5.0-stop-faster shutter speed, so the Î±7 III can take full advantage of its high-quality imaging capability and live-view image performance. Furthermore, it functions with A-mount lenses attached via mount adaptor, as well as E-mount lenses. 


Longer battery life
For extended periods of confident shooting, the NP-FZ100 battery has approximately 2.2 times the capacity of a NP-FW50 battery that allows shooting of up to approximately 710 photos with one full charge and an optional VG-C3EM Vertical Grip can hold two batteries. USB Type-Câ¢ and Multi/Micro USB ports allow external mobile batteries to power the camera for extended recording. Even more conveniently, accessories such as a remote control unit can be used via Multi/Micro USB port while power is supplied via USB Type-Câ¢ port. BC-QZ1 optional battery charger allows quicker charging than charging via USB.


Location Information Link via Bluetooth
he camera can be paired with PlayMemories Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile phone or tablet device to acquire location data, record it on still images, and correct camera date/time and location settings. PlayMemories Home application can be used on a personal computer to organise imported still images on a map.

ne-touch remote can turn a smartphone or tablet into a viewfinder/remote control. One-touch sharing transfers photos/videos to your device for SNS sharing. Just install a PlayMemories Mobile app via Wi-Fi to your NFC-enabled Android device, and then touch the device to the camera to connect them. If you donât have NFC, use QR code compatibility to pair the devices.


Touch screen LCD
3.0-type 922K-dot LCD screen offers touch screen operation and bright, clear, finely detailed views even outdoors. Use Touch Focus to focus instantly on a point that you touch on the screen and Touch Pad to drag the focus frame with a fingertip on the LCD as you monitor the shot through the viewfinder.

The a7R III is capable of 10 fps silent shooting with full autofocus and 8fps in Live View. The a7R III inherits the 3.69M-dot OLED viewfinder from the Sony a9 along with the the higher-capacity battery of the a9. The standard ISO range has been extended to ISO 100-32000 (expandable to ISO 50-102400), and noise has been reduced by as much as a full stop in the mid sensitivity range. 


Back-illuminated 42.4MP full-frame sensor
The 35mm full-frame Exmor R CMOS image sensor features 42.4-megapixel resolution, back illumination and gapless on-chip lens design for extraordinary sensitivity and dynamic range, anti-reflection (AR) coating on sensor seal glass, and other innovations that unleash the sensorâs power to make images look realistic.


Image processing engine
The latest front-end LSI makes data readout from the image sensor approximately two times faster and the BIONZ X image processor is now about 1.8 times faster. Enhanced image processing realizes lower noise and further extended dynamic range across a wide sensitivity range of up to ISO 32000 (standard ISO, expandable to ISO 50-102400 for stills). Moreover, upgraded Detail Reproduction and Area-specific Noise Reduction achieves noise reduction â equivalent of approx. one stop â in mid-range ISO settings. Also, reproduction of skin colour has been dramatically improved, which is advantageous for portrait shooting. The Î±7R III also supports 14-bit RAW output even during silent shooting/continuous shooting.

Highly durable and operable in tough conditions
The a7R III body is fortified by lightweight, high-rigidity magnesium alloy top cover, front cover, internal frame, and rear cover. The number of lens mount screws has been increased to six for enhanced durability. Major buttons and dials are sealed. Sealing is provided throughout the body to minimise entry of dust and moisture.


AF performance
An evolved image processing system and Î±9 camera AF algorithms optimised for the Î±7R III improve AF speed, precision, and tracking performance. 399 phase-detection AF points and 425 contrast-detection AF points provide high-density wide-area coverage. Up to approximately two times faster AF speed and two times more precise AF tracking performance let you capture and maintain focus on nimble wildlife in unpredictable motion. The Î±7R III also autofocuses reliably down to EV-3 brightness.


Eye AF with doubled tracking performance
Eye AFâs enhanced precision, plus two times greater AF speed and AF tracking performance14 further assist you to easily shoot a portrait of a moving subject using AF-C even during continuous shooting, and even if the subject looks down and away from the camera, or is backlit with face in partial darkness. The Î±7R IIIâs E-mount body supports Eye AF for A-mount lenses mounted via an adaptor.


Up to 10fps with AF/AE tracking
With new shutter unit and image processing system refinements, the Î±7R III can shoot continuously at up to 10fps with AF/AE tracking (up to 8fps with minimal display lag in live-view continuous shooting mode) for easy, stable shooting of even intensely active subjects. An electronic shutter allows silent, vibration-free shooting of wildlife when even slight noise can mean missing an ideal shot.


Up to 76 images in continuous shooting
Greater buffer memory, system speed, and UHS-II support allow the Î±7R III to capture up to approx. 28 uncompressed RAW, or 76 compressed RAW or JPEG images in a continuous burst at 10fps. Fn menu/menu display access, setting changes and review playback can occur during data writing. A countdown of the number of still images remaining to be written to memory is on display during playback.


In-body 5-axis image stabilisation with up to 5.5-stop shutter speed advantage
Now more effective than ever for the Î± series, this comprehensive system compensates for five types of camera shake that tend to blur images: pitch/yaw shake when shooting at longer focal lengths; X/Y shake in close-up (including macro) shooting; and roll shake when recording stills at night and movies. It effectively achieves 5.5-stop-faster shutter speed, so the Î±7R III can take full advantage of its 42.4-megapixel and live-view image performance. Furthermore, it functions with A-mount lenses attached via mount adaptor, as well as E-mount lenses.


Pixel Shift Multi Shooting
Applying mechanisms and control technology of image stabilisation, this new feature composites four separate pixel-shifted images that contain total data equal to approx. 169.6 million, or 42.4 million x 4 (RGGB), pixels to reproduce a single optimal still image of super-high resolution, detailed texture, balanced colour, and realistic atmosphere, with minimal moirÃ© and colour artifacts. Images shot using this feature can be processed with the new Sony imaging software suite. The image sensor is moved in 1-pixel increments while shooting four sequential frames. Each pixel represents R, G, and B information.  


3.69-million-dot, high-luminance Quad-VGA OLED Tru-Finder
This approximately 3.69-million-dot Quad-VGA OLED Tru-Finder provides accurate detail, contrast, and black reproduction, while maintaining natural image brightness. High-quality mode, suitable for fine focus adjustment, takes full advantage of rich image data from the image sensor to display more natural high-precision images with minimal moirÃ© and jagginess, so you can concentrate more on shooting. Furthermore, you can choose 120/100fps from the selection of frame rates for the viewfinder to make motion look particularly smooth. Only an EVF such as this one could offer features such as a powerfully enhanced focus magnifier that allows autofocus while a chosen focus area is magnified in the viewfinder.


Touch screen LCD for intuitive focus operations
A 3.0-type LCD touch screen with 1.44 million dots makes focus operation intuitive and instant. You can simply touch the monitor screen to specify a desired focus point with Touch Focus. Also, Touch Pad function lets you drag the focus frame to another point with a fingertip on the LCD screen as you monitor the shot through the viewfinder. 


Enhanced flash compatibility
The Î±7R III has new sync terminals, so non-dedicated flash units and cables with standard sync terminals can be connected for convenient synchronisation with studio flash units, etc. Release time lag when shooting with flash is minimised for smooth, responsive flash photography. Continuous flash shooting at up to 10fps offers advanced capture capability. To enhance versatility further, slow sync and rear curtain sync can be selected when shooting with wireless off-camera flash.


Clear, natural, realistic 4K movies
For high-resolution 4K movies33 with minimal moirÃ© and jaggies, Super 35mm mode with full-pixel readout without pixel binning condenses approximately 1.8 times the amount of data required for 4K movies (QFHD: 3840 x 2160). Advanced image processing makes it possible to record full-frame 4K movies with dramatically improved image quality in the mid-to-high ISO range, so you make the most of the 4K movie formatâs unique potential in every shot.

The Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G80 is the successor to the Panasonic G7 and includes the same 16 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor as the G7 but with no AA filter.
The Lumix G8 also upgrades with a new Venus Engine, 2.36M dot OLED Electronic Viewfinder with increased magnification and longer eyepoint, in-body 5-axis Dual image stabilization and new in-camera focus-stacking mode. The rugged magnesium body construction is splashproof and dustproof, so it's ideal for outdoor everyday use. Easy Wireless Connectivity via Wi-Fi lets you connect with your smartphone.





Stunning clarity with every shot 
.The new LUMIX DMC-G80 features an updated Image Stabilization system â the 5-axis Dual I.S. MK II  By incorporating new gyro-sensor technology, the O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) and B.I.S. (Body Image Stabilizer, 5-axis) are able to work in perfect harmony and with outstanding accuracy. With improved suppression of blur, resulting pictures and videos remain beautifully crisp despite vibrations caused by shaking hands or traversing outdoor terrain. 


With the LUMIX DMC-G80âs ability to analyse shooting conditions, including focal length, the new Dual I.S. system is able to utilise max. 5-stop slower shutter speed . Users can also enjoy blur-free photo/video shooting in both wide angle and telephoto, even in low light situations or when shooting with one hand. 


To further minimise unwanted vibration, the LUMIX DMC-G80 also utilises an electromagnetic drive in the shutter unit. The shock caused by the movement of shutter diaphragm is dramatically reduced and shutter sound is also minimised. Together with the adoption of solid magnesium for the front panel, shutter vibration is reduced by approx. 90% compared with the DMC-G80âs predecessor, the G7.


Power to deliver the highest quality
The 16.0-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor and new Venus Engine combine to allow users to shoot vibrant, true-to-life high quality images with excellent resolution, high contrast, impressive colour reproduction and max. ISO 25600 high sensitivity.


By removing the Low Pass Filter from the DMC-G80âs sensor, the limiting resolution is improved by approx. 10%. At the same time, the Venus Engine reproduces vibrant, impressive colour â such as clear sky â by dividing hue, saturation and luminosity and finely adjusting them individually. Taking advantage of this fine tuning capability, the LUMIX G80 enables users to choose a pre-set of contrast, sharpness, saturation and noise reduction that suits their environment and shooting style.


Panasonicâs LUMIX G cameras are not only renowned for their still image quality, but also for their high quality video capability in 4K. The LUMIX DMC-G80 records stunningly smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K video in 3840x2160 at 25p (50Hz) or 24p in MP4 in addition to full-HD 1,920 x 1,080 at 50p (50 Hz) videos in AVCHD Progressive or MP4 (MPEG-4 / H.264) format with practical full-time AF.


Capture those photo opportunities 
Utilising the LUMIX DMC-G80âs exceptional 4K video recording capability, the 4K Photo function allows users to extract an 8-megapixel still with exact precision, enabling even the most fleeting moment to be caught in a still image.


Three exclusive 4K Photo functions are integrated into the LUMIX DMC-G80: 4K Burst Shooting, 4K Burst (Start/Stop) and 4K Pre-burst; all of which help allow photographers to capture and record that perfect picture by cropping the exact frame they want out from the recorded 4K video footage.


In addition to 4K Photo, the DMC-G80âs contrast AF achieves even faster and more precise focusing with digital signal communication at max. 240 fps. The Contrast AF system in the LUMIX DMC-G80 is further enhanced by Panasonicâs integration of Depth From Defocus (DFD) technology  which shortens the focusing time even further. 


Even if focus is not exactly as the user intended when the shutter is pressed, the LUMIX DMC-G80 also comes with the Post Focus function that enables users to select the specific focal point even after shooting â particularly helpful in situations like macro shooting where severe focusing is required. The camera now supports a Focus Stacking function. As taking a single macro photo with specific areas in focus can sometimes be difficult, Focus Stacking enables users to take multiple images of the same frame with different aperture values, then combine them into one image and select the area to be in focus.


In addition, Low Light AF makes it possible to set focus on the subject more precisely in extremely low-lit situations (-4EV) such as wildlife photography at dawn or dusk, while Starlight AF, allows budding astronomers to capture individual stars and constellations in the night sky.


Tough and versatile design
To withstand the demands of heavy field use, the DMC-G80 adopts rugged design with a full die-cast magnesium front frame. It also features splash and dustproof construction thanks to the careful sealing on every joint, dial and button.


To further enhance control, the LUMIX DMC-G80 comes with ergonomically-designed thick grip for a stable holding even in one hand. The front/rear dual dial system enables direct setting. For example, users can adjust white balance with a front dial and set ISO with a rear dial while choosing the shutter speed or monitoring the noise effect on the rear screen â ideal when dealing with complex lighting situations.


The DMC-G80 boasts a large 2,360K-dot OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) LVF (Live View Finder) with a magnification ratio of approx. 1.48x / 0.74x (35mm camera equiv.) and 100% field of view. It delivers high speed response with minimum time lag of less than 0.01 sec as well as 10,000:1 high contrast for exceptional visibility, plus, the eye point of approximately 20 mm offers high visibility and comfort even for users wearing glasses.


The LVF also comes with a new Power Save Mode. If the sensor detects that the eye has moved away from the LVF, the camera automatically enters sleep mode after 3, 5 or 10 seconds. When the shutter button is half pressed, it instantly switches back into shooting mode. This feature helps to increase the amount of shots that can be taken with one battery charge by almost three times, from 320 to 800-900. 


Adopting a static-type touch control system, the 3-inch (7,62cm), 1040K-dot, free-angle rear screen is easy and intuitively to control. It also tilts vertically by 270-degree, which makes shooting overhead or at low angles even easier.

The Sony a7 Mark III features a newly developed 24.2MP full-frame CMOS back-illuminated sensor for incredible sensitivity and dynamic range. The a7 III also includes improved AF speed, precision and tracking performance. 693 phase-detection AF points and up to 10 frames per second shooting. The ISO can be extended to an amazing 50 to 204800 (stills) and the new battery  allows shooting of up to approximately 710 photos. 4K video is also included along with improved Fast Hybrid AF for movie recording.





Back-illuminated 24.2MP full-frame sensor
The 35mm full-frame Exmor Râ¢ CMOS image sensor features 24.2-megapixel resolution, back illumination, and gapless on-chip lens design for extraordinary sensitivity and dynamic range. Two times faster data readout speed is achieved through copper wires and front-end LSI.


Enhanced image processing system
A combination of new-generation image processing system and a new sensor achieves an up to 1.5-stop improvement12 in image quality. A wide ISO sensitivity range of up to ISO 51200 is standard, and approx. up to 15-stop13 dynamic range at low sensitivity settings is realised. Upgraded Detail Reproduction and Area-specific Noise Reduction join to suppress noise and maintain a sense of high overall resolution. Colour reproduction, especially of skin and nature scenes, has also been dramatically improved. The Î±7 III also supports 14-bit RAW output even during silent shooting/continuous shooting.


Wider, faster AF performance
An evolved image processing system and Î±9 camera AF algorithms optimised for the Î±7 III improve AF speed, precision, and tracking performance. 693 phase-detection AF points and 425 contrast-detection AF points provide high-density wide-area coverage. AF speed improved by up to twice and more precise AF tracking performance let you capture and maintain focus on a quickly moving subject in unpredictable motion. The Î±7 III also autofocuses reliably down to EV-3 brightness.


New AF-ON button and multi-selector
The new AF-ON button activates autofocus without any half-press-shutter-button focus sequence, so you can concentrate better on exactly when to release the shutter and capture the moment instantly. A multi-selector lets you shift the point of focus quickly and efficiently. You can select and shift the point of focus intuitively, so you wonât miss great chances to shoot moving subjects.


Eye AF now supporting AF-C
Eye AF newly supports AF-C mode with greater precision that dramatically enhances portrait shooting, plus higher AF speed that makes it easier to shoot a portrait of a moving subject, even if the subject looks down and away from the camera, or is backlit with face in partial darkness. The Î±7 III supports Eye AF for A-mount lenses mounted via an adaptor.


Comprehensive AF
AF tracking sensitivity when shooting stills is adjustable in five steps for subjects that move outside of the focus area. Autofocus areas and points remain the same or change when switching between horizontal and vertical orientations, depending on the shooting situation. AF area registration allows frequently used focus point settings to be memorised and assigned to custom buttons for fast, convenient recall at a touch whenever needed.


Up to 10 fps with AF/AE tracking
With new shutter charge unit and image processing system refinements, the Î±7 III can shoot continuously at up to 10 fps with AF/AE tracking (up to 8 fps with minimal display lag in live-view continuous shooting mode) for easy, stable shooting of even intensely active subjects. Up to approximately 177 JPEG images (standard) in full resolution, 89 compressed RAW images, or 40 uncompressed RAW images can be captured in one continuous burst. An electronic shutter allows silent, vibration-free shooting of wildlife and other sensitive situations when even slight noise can mean missing an ideal shot.


Anti-flicker shooting
Flicker from fluorescent and other artificial lighting is automatically detected and shutter action is timed to minimise the flickerâs effect on still images. This suppresses exposure and colour anomalies at the top and bottom of images shot at high shutter speeds, as well as exposure and colour inconsistency between continuous shots, so you can take images indoors with more confidence.


4K movies
High-resolution full-frame 4K movies24 with full-pixel readout without pixel binning that condenses approximately 2.4 times the amount of data required for 4K movies (QFHD: 3840 x 2160) results in minimal moirÃ© and jaggies. Advanced image processing makes it possible to record full-frame 4K movies with outstanding image quality in the mid-to-high ISO range, so you make the most of the 4K movie formatâs unique potential in every shot. Super 35mm can also be selected, instead of full-frame mode, as needed.


Versatile movie recording functions
The Î±7 III provides a wide array of functions to facilitate workflows of professional videographers, including clean HDMI output, time code / user bits (TC/UB), rec. control, marker display/setting, zebra function, Slow and Quick Motion, simultaneous proxy movie recording, extraction and separate storage of a still from a movie, and Gamma Display Assist function, among others.


Fast Hybrid AF for movie recording
An efficient combination of focal-plane phase-detection AF and contrast-detection AF accurately locks onto even fast-moving subjects, then tracks them smoothly during movie recording. AF coverage for movies extends across an area almost as wide as the AF coverage area for still images, so once the high-density AF system locks onto a movie subject, the camera continues to track it steadily and tenaciously. Three AF drive speed settings give you freedom to use slow focus effects when shooting movie scenes.


In-body 5-axis image stabilisation with 5.0-stop shutter speed
This comprehensive system compensates for five types of camera shake that tend to blur images: pitch/yaw shake when shooting at longer focal lengths; X/Y shake in close-up (including macro) shooting; and roll shake when recording stills at night and movies. It effectively achieves 5.0-stop-faster shutter speed, so the Î±7 III can take full advantage of its high-quality imaging capability and live-view image performance. Furthermore, it functions with A-mount lenses attached via mount adaptor, as well as E-mount lenses. 


Longer battery life
For extended periods of confident shooting, the NP-FZ100 battery has approximately 2.2 times the capacity of a NP-FW50 battery that allows shooting of up to approximately 710 photos with one full charge and an optional VG-C3EM Vertical Grip can hold two batteries. USB Type-Câ¢ and Multi/Micro USB ports allow external mobile batteries to power the camera for extended recording. Even more conveniently, accessories such as a remote control unit can be used via Multi/Micro USB port while power is supplied via USB Type-Câ¢ port. BC-QZ1 optional battery charger allows quicker charging than charging via USB.


Location Information Link via Bluetooth
he camera can be paired with PlayMemories Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile phone or tablet device to acquire location data, record it on still images, and correct camera date/time and location settings. PlayMemories Home application can be used on a personal computer to organise imported still images on a map.


One-touch remote & One-touch sharing
ne-touch remote can turn a smartphone or tablet into a viewfinder/remote control. One-touch sharing transfers photos/videos to your device for SNS sharing. Just install a PlayMemories Mobile app via Wi-Fi to your NFC-enabled Android device, and then touch the device to the camera to connect them. If you donât have NFC, use QR code compatibility to pair the devices.


Touch screen LCD
3.0-type 922K-dot LCD screen offers touch screen operation and bright, clear, finely detailed views even outdoors. Use Touch Focus to focus instantly on a point that you touch on the screen and Touch Pad to drag the focus frame with a fingertip on the LCD as you monitor the shot through the viewfinder. This LCD tilts up by as much as 107Â°, and down by as much as 41Â° for flexible, convenient camera holding and shot monitoring. 


High-resolution, high-contrast XGA OLED Tru-Finder
Providing high resolution and contrast, plus the excellent gradation and colour reproduction that are advantages of OLED viewfinders, this approximately 2359K-dot XGA OLED Tru-Finder faithfully depicts images with clear corner-to-corner visibility. Magnification is 0.78x (approx. 38.5Â° diagonal FOV). ZEISS T* coating greatly reduces obtrusive lens reflection on the ocular lens. Startup is approximately 40% faster than with the Î±7 II when the camera is switched on. Furthermore, view mode can be set to âHighâ to provide finer and more natural details by taking maximum advantage of the data read from the 24.2 effective megapixel sensor.


Highly durable and operable in tough conditions
The Î±7 III functions reliably in challenging environments. Its body is fortified by lightweight, high-rigidity magnesium alloy top cover, front cover, and internal frame. The number of lens mount screws has been increased to six for enhanced durability. Major buttons and dials are sealed. Sealing is provided throughout the body to minimise entry of dust and moisture.

The Panasonic HC-X1 Camcorder features a host
of high-end functions and specifications to meet
professional 4K video production needs. It's equipped with a newly designed compact lens featuring a wide 24mm angle and optical 20x zoom as well as an effective 1.0-type high-sensitivity MOS sensor. Its evolved Optical Image Stabilizer (O.I.S.) and high-speed intelligent AF function are suitable for professional camera work.


The HC-X1 supports 4K 24p, UHD 60p/50p, FHD 60p/50p
multi-format recording and HD super slow-motion. Two SD
memory card slots are provided to enable relay/simultaneous/backup recording for enhanced
reliability, and also support UHD/FHD dual codec
recording for a more efficient workflow. The HC-X1's control functions, such as the triple manual
rings and user buttons, as well as interfaces, such as XLR input and wired remote terminal, are engineered to meet the needs of professional video recording.


High-Sensitivity 1.0-type (inch) 4K Sensor
An effective 1.0-type (inch) MOS sensor (approx. 9.46
megapixels in 4K 24p, approx. 8.79 megapixels in
UHD/FHD) provides an appropriate depth of field and
excellent balance between image quality and sensitivity.
Images can also be recorded with a resolution of 4K
(4096 x 2160)/24p, UHD(3840 x 2160)/60p/50p or FHD
(1920 x 1080)/60p/50p.


4-Drive Lens System
The 4-Drive Lens System simultaneously and
independently drives 4 lens groups (group 2, iris, group
3, group 4). The lens size and drive range for each of the 4 groups can be efficiently suppressed to optimize image quality, zoom power, and achieve compact body.


World's First 20x optical 20x Zoom in a
Camcorder with 1.0-type (inch) Sensor
The optical 20x zoom lens covers the range from 24mm
wide-angle to 480mm telescopic (35mm film equivalent
at 4K 24p). The lens can zoom from wide-angle to
telescopic very quickly. In FHD shooting modes, the Intelligent Zoom function
increases the zooming capability to a maximum of
approximately 30x, while maintaining high resolution.
When it reaches to 20x optical zoom limit, it seamlessly
switches to Intelligent Zoom.


24mm at the Wide-Angle Setting
The integrated lens boasts the industry's widest angle of 24mm at the wide-angle setting. It enables wide-angle
shooting with little distortion, without the use of a wide conversion lens and also allows video
recording/production in narrow spaces.


Advanced Optical Image Stabilizer
[4K/UHD/FHD]
The correction area of the Optical Image Stabilizer
(O.I.S.) has been expanded to approximately 900% over
the conventional area. This provides powerful correction even in unstable shooting situations, such as low-angle or high-angle shots. The ball OIS system reduces wear on
the drive section, and greatly improves correction for
small-amplitude hand-shake.


5-Axis HYBRID O.I.S.
In HD shooting modes, by using hand-shake correction
that combines the effects of both optical and electronic
image stabilization, hand-shake in various directions,
including the roll rotation, is detected and corrected.


High-Speed, High-Precision Intelligent AF
By moving the Micro Drive Focus Unit minutely and
quickly, highly precise AF performance is also achieved
when shooting in 4K or shooting with a shallow depth of
field. Auto focus operation can be customized by adjusting the AF Speed, AF Sensitivity and AF Area Width. This function enables the AF to operate exactly as intended by the user in accordance with the subject type or application.


Super-Slow Motion
Slow-motion effect can be achieved by high-speed HD recording at 120 fps (59.94 Hz) or 100 fps (50 Hz).

Infrared Shooting
The IR Cut Filter can be turned ON/OFF (allocated on the User button). When the filter is turned off, commercially available IR lights can be used for shooting in dark places.

Adoption of OLED for the LVF achieves smooth display at 120 fps and high speed response with minimum lag of less than 0.005 sec as well as 10,000:1 high contrast for exceptional visibility.


Splash / Dust / Freezeproof body
To withstand heavy field use, the LUMIX G9 is constructed of a magnesium alloy full die-cast front / rear frame and is not only splash proof  and dustproof but also freezeproof down to -10 degrees centigrade. 


On top Status LCD and 3-inch 1,040k-dot free-angle monitor plus dual card slot
The largest-in-class Status LCD on the top makes shooting even easier and more comfortable. For the rear monitor, a 3.0-inch free-angle LCD in 3:2 aspect with 1,040K-dot high resolution is equipped. The G9 has a double SD Memory Card slot, compatible with the high-speed, high-capacity UHS-II cards. 


Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity

The GX80 features 4K Video shooting which is four times the resolution and clarity of traditional Full HD, as well as 4K PHOTO, which allows you to capture even the most intimate, fleeting moments by selecting the perfect 8-megapixel still image from a 4K Video.


Image Stabilisation
Featuring Panasonicâs newly developed 5-axis Dual Image Stabilisation technology, both the cameraâs body and lens feature high-end image stabilisation, so you can achieve stunning imagery, even when shooting out of the hand and on the move. The benefits are even more apparent when in high zoom mode or in low-light, meaning that youâll get results you can be proud of, even in tricky environments.


Accurate focus before and after the shot
The DMC-GX80âs Contrast AF System features DFD (Depth From Defocus) technology and excels in both speed and accuracy. Digital signals are sent between the camera and the lens at max. 240 fps, resulting in ultra-fast auto focusing of approx. 0.07 sec.


The camera also features Panasonicâs innovative Post Focus function, allowing you to change the focus areas of the image even after shooting. This means you can totally change the perspective of your work â from choosing which face you want to be in focus in a busy street scene to adding more background warmth to a close-up macro shot.  Operation is easy. After shooting in Post Focus mode, you simply touch the screen at the point where you want to set focus when reviewing the image.


Live View Finder
The GX80 includes a LVF (Live View Finder) with 2764K-dot equivalent high resolution and approximate 100% colour reproduction. The 16:9 Wide Screen LVF boasts approx.1.39x / 0.7x (35mm camera equiv.) magnification, 100% field of view and an Eye Sensor. This sensor triggers Eye Sensor AF and brings your chosen frame into focus by the time you look through the shutter. 


Touch-screen monitor
A large 3.0-inch, approx.1040K-dot high resolution static-type touch monitor offers a secondary shooting method and also boasts approx. 100% of field of view. This folding screen makes shooting awkward situations much easier. An 80-degree upward tilt is ideal when shooting from street level, while a 45-degree upward tilt is perfect for shooting overhead, such as at crowded music events.  


Wi-Fi connectivity
With in-built Wi-Fi connectivity, you can also connect the camera to your smartphone or tablet giving you remote shooting options, as well as share your work instantly, wherever you are. 


Creative functions
The LUMIX DMC-GX80 is packed with the latest artistic functions and technologies that mean you can always add your own creative style to your work, without the need for complex post-production. The Creative Control mode features a total of 22 filter options, while the camera also offers a newly integrated L.Monochrome mode, providing monochrome pictures with the rich gradation that can give your photography the style of a black and white film.


The GX80 also enables innovative 4K Live Cropping for editing video on the camera. For panning, you can simply set the viewing angle to get a smooth panning shot without the need for special equipment like a slider. For zooming, you can set the frame you want to finish with, and the camera will automatically zoom from wide angle to tele.

Capture wildlife from a safe distance, shoot stars in the night sky, or take impressive shots at sporting events with the outstandingly long-range 60x NIKKOR zoom lens, extendable to 120x Dynamic Fine ZoomÂ¹. The zoom range covers from 24 mm wide angle to super-telephoto 1440 mm angles of view (equivalent in 35 mm format) and supports powerful macro photography for subjects as close as approximately 1 cm to the lens. Superior performance is guaranteed with trusted NIKKOR optics, featuring Super ED glass. A Super ED lens has advanced capabilities, including an extremely high ability to remove secondary spectra, offering superior chromatic aberration correction characteristics.


20.3 effective megapixel CMOS Sensor and high performance AF system 
The high megapixel count of the cameraâs CMOS image sensor allows in more light for finer detail capture in your images, while the ultra-responsive high-speed AF locks onto your subject rapidly, so youâll never miss a decisive moment. Target finding AF allows for more flexible composition, as the optimal focus area size and position are chosen according to the subject. When you aim your camera at your subject, it instantly predicts the area where focus should be acquired. The active focus area is automatically set in relation to the size of the subject, ensuring all images will be in clear focus. Target finding AF is as effective with subjects in the centre of frame as those that are off-centre, and works as well for smaller subjects like flowers and food as it does for human subjects.


4K UHD/30P movies with stereo sound 
Shoot impressively smooth movies in 4K Ultra High Definition (3840x2160/30p) â ensuring that your recordings are state-of-the-art and future-proof as 4K UHD becomes standard â with great sound quality from the zoom microphone, which adjusts directivity along with zoom operation. Start filming instantly with a dedicated movie-record button. HDMI support means you can connect your camera to a TV or other external monitor with an optional HDMI cable.


Built-in Elelctronic Viewfinder (EVF)
The high-definition 921k-dot, 0.2-in LCD (with diopter adjustment) electronic viewfinder gives 100% of frame coverage, so youâll always know exactly what youâre shooting. Switch shooting styles seamlessly from screen to viewfinder, as the eye sensor automatically switches from monitor shooting when your eye gets close to the sensor. Viewfinder shooting is useful for cramped conditions and also ensures stable posture, minimising camera shake.


Vari-angle LCD monitor
The large vari-angle screen gives huge flexibility for creating different viewpoints â shoot high over crowds at concerts, take a low angle for wildlife and nature images, or shoot at a completely unique angle for architectural or travel shots. Self-shooting is simple with the vari-angle monitor, making it easy to add your personal commentary to the movies youâre shooting or snap a quick selfie when youâre in an unusual location. RGBW alignment provides superior visibility even in direct sunlight and offers low power consumption.


5-stop dual detect optical VR
Vibration reduction reduces camera shake so youâll always get sharp images with optimal exposure, regardless of your shooting conditions. The 5-stop Dual Detect Optical VRÂ² gives a compensation effect equivalent to a shutter speed 5 stops faster. This can eliminate the need for faster shutter speeds, preventing issues like improper exposure or over-increased sensitivity. By utilising the camera shake information detected by the angular velocity sensor together with the data on direction and amount of camera shake (motion vector information), the newly-developed VR algorithm enables a more accurate calculation of the amount of image blur to achieve a greatly enhanced vibration reduction performance.


Snapbridge
SnapBridge maintains a constant, low-power connection between your camera and your smartphone or tablet to give you easy control over your photographic life. Now you can sync shots to your smart device while you shoot, and share Nikon-quality images in an instant. You can also control key camera functions via your phone, keep your camera on time and up-to-date, and more.


Fast start-up time, high-speed AF, short shooting time lag 
When there are no second chances for a shot, you can rely on the super-responsive operation of the B700. With a fast start-up time of approximately 1.3 seconds, High-speed AF giving you crystal clear focus in around 0.9 seconds, and short shooting time lag, youâll be capturing the action the second that it starts. Youâll never miss a crucial moment again.


Shhot RAW images
Shooting RAW in Nikonâs NRW format means you never have to worry about any degradation in image quality. When images are written to the memory card in NRW format, the exposure compensation, white balance, hue, tone and sharpening information are saved as instruction sets within the file. You can change the instruction set on your images as many times as you like without ever disturbing the original RAW data.

The Canon EOS 5DS R is a tough, full-frame DSLR with a 50.6 megapixel full frame CMOS sensor and Low-pass cancelation filter that maximises the sharpness of the cameraâs sensor. Features include  Dual DIGIC 6 processors for super-fast image processing, 61-point AF, 5fps continuous shooting, reduced mirror vibration for maximum sharpness and USB 3.0 interface.        



Capture extraordinary detail
The 50.6 megapixel full frame CMOS sensor is capable of recording extraordinary levels of detail. The ultra-high resolution enables extensive cropping and still delivers stunning image quality. Even the built in 1.3x and 1.6x cropped shooting modes produce 30.5 and 19.6 megapixel files, respectively.


Fast image processing & responsiveness
Enjoy fast image processing and camera responsiveness â even with the large amounts of data captured by the 50.6-MP sensor - thanks to the Dual DIGIC 6 processors. You can catch all the action with an unrivalled ability to capture 50.6-MP resolution images at 5fps while USB 3.0 connectivity allows fast tethered shooting and remote camera control.


Low-pass cancelation filter
Conventional DSLR designs use a low-pass filter in front of the cameraâs sensor to prevent digital artefacts, like moirÃ© and false colour. Such filters soften the image slightly, so the low-pass effect is cancelled in the EOS 5DS R for the sharpest possible performance. The small risk of artefacts as a consequence of this makes EOS 5DS R a good option when shooting outdoors or in controlled studio conditions.


61-point wide-area autofocus
Focus quickly and precisely, even in low-light conditions using a 61-point AF System. 41 cross-type focus points, including five extra-sensitive double cross-type, provide extra accuracy.


AF Point Selection
Use all 61 AF points together, or group them into moveable zones that cover off-centre subjects. Alternatively, select just a single AF point to focus precisely on a specific part of the scene.


Advanced subject tracking and recognition
EOS Intelligent Tracking and Recognition (iTR) AF technology uses colour and face information to recognise and track subjects as they move around the frame. AF responsiveness can be customised using a simple tool, which adjusts the focus tracking according to the shooting environment and subject, so that other objects passing momentarily in front of the subject donât interfere with focusing.


Weather sealing

The main differences and improvements from the RX100 and RX100 II include a new 24-70mm (35mm equivalent) f/1.8-2.8 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens, a pop-up SVGA OLED Electronic Viewfinder plus Sony's Bionz X processor. 


20.1MP (effective) 1.0-type back-illuminated Exmor R CMOS sensor
See more detail with a bigger sensor. 20.1 effective MP 1.0-type Exmor R CMOS sensor ensures bright, clear detail in all your photos and video. You get four times better light capture with a back-illuminated sensor. By placing the metal wiring in the back, rather than the front, Sonyâs design creates a light-capturing area approximately four times larger than that of standard sensors. 


ZEISSÂ® Vario-Sonnar T* 24-70mm F1.8-2.8 lens
The RX100 III design features a versatile fixed lens of renowned ZEISSÂ® quality. Up to 9 aspherical lens elements are used, among which two AA (advanced aspherical) lenses are cemented accurately to contribute to the downsizing of the whole lens unit while keeping the superb optical performance. The 24mm wide-angle gets more of the sceneâideal for architecture and landscapes, while the 70mm at a bright F2.8 is great for portraits, close-ups (30cm distance), and creative background blurring. The lens also features a built-in 1/8 ND filter that allows the exposure to be adjusted by 3-EV step equivalents to handle bright scenes. (Note: the 24-70mm specs are a 35mm equivalent).


BIONZ X image processing engine
The BIONZ X image processing engine incorporates sophisticated detail reproduction technology, diffraction reducing technology, and improved area-specific noise reduction while offering approximately three times more processing power than the previous BIONZ engine to enable faithful, realistic reproduction of high-definition details and textures in realtime.


Built-in electronic viewfinder
Built into a camera body equal in size to the RX100 is an OLED Tru-Finder that enables faster, more accurate photo composition. The viewfinder is comprised of a high-contrast, high-resolution EL screen of approximately 1440k dots and features a ZEISSÂ® T* coating that enhances clarity in the eyepiece optics. For stress-free shooting, an eye sensor allows instant shifting between the viewfinder and LCD screen.


XAVC S and AVCHD for advanced recording
The high-bit-rate XAVC S format is provided for serious videographers. It enables Full HD image recording at 50Mbps for extremely high-quality expression and minimal noise. It also employs the Long GOP (Group of Pictures) data compression method to realize efficient movie recording. Furthermore, you can shoot Full Hi-Def with AVCHD, then easily edit that format in many different programs.


50 Mbps captures fast-moving scenes with excellent quality
In addition to AVCHD format, the RX100 III is the first Cyber-shot camera to offer XAVC S, the consumer variant of the professional XAVC format. Full HD (1920 x 1080) 60p (or 50p) recording at a bit rate of 50 Mbps clearly captures complex motion as seen in water spray or large crowds with stunning resolution. Audio is recorded in linear PCM format. Sequences recorded at the 120p high frame rate that is also included can be reproduced in slow-motion at 24p, and varied in speed by up to five times with impressively smooth results. Please note: 1) An SDXC memory card with a Class 10 or higher speed rating is required for XAVC S recording; 2) 120p recordings are captured at HD (1280 x 720) resolution. Intelligent Active Mode and Active Mode cannot be used when recording at 120p; 3) The camera does not provide slow-motion playback capability. PlayMemories Homeâ¢ can be used for slow-motion playback.


180-degree tilting LCD screen
A 3.0-inch, 1229k-dot extra-fine LCD screen tilts up to 180 degrees for easier selfies or group shots, and down to help compose your shot in macro mode.


Area-specific noise reduction
Area-specific noise reduction is now more powerful than ever. It selectively divides the image into areas based on patterns (such as edges, textures and evenly coloured areas like blue skies), and then applies the most appropriate noise reduction for each area to improve image quality, especially at high-sensitivity settings. Working together with Sony's detail reproduction, it gives supremely clear, detailed images.


Lock-on autofocus and area setting options
Lock-on AF adjusts the target frame size based on subject characteristics and makes use of a wide AF area to ensure usage of the optimal AF point for smooth, stable autofocusing. New BIONZ X ensures swifter subject tracking and detection performance than ever before.


Eye autofocus
Even when capturing a subject partially turned away from the camera with a shallow depth of field, the face will be sharply focused thanks to extremely accurate eye detection that can prioritize a single pupil. A green frame appears over the prioritized eye when focus has been achieved for easy confirmation.


Manual focus options
Features such as MF Assist (enlarging the image) and Peaking (highlighting edges in focus) make it easy to incorporate manual focus in your shooting when you desire the added flexibility.

20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor
The 20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor comes without a low-pass filter to ensure the greatest details are captured and an optimised gradation setting provides a wide dynamic range. Three-dimensional Colour Control detects hue, saturation levels and brightness individually and achieves the truest colour reproduction from dark to bright parts of the image - especially improving skies or human skin. 


Image Stabilisation
For greater precision, the Lumix GX9 incorporates 5-axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabiliser) for more effective suppression of blur. Combining an O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabiliser, 2-axis) and a B.I.S. (Body Image Stabiliser, 5-axis), the 5-axis Dual I.S. compensates for a larger range of movement, making it possible to use 4-stop slower shutter speed. Users can enjoy blur-free photo/video shooting from wide to tele, even in low-light situations. 


The 5-axis Dual I.S. works in both photo and motion picture recording including 4K video. Panasonic Lumix G Cameras offer a wide variety of digital interchangeable lenses and most of them comply with this 5-axis dual I.S. 


Silent Mode
To further reduce motion blur, the Lumix GX9âs shutter unit incorporates an electromagnetic drive which reduces the risk of shutter shock by approximately 90%. For street photographers who need to minimise disrupting their subjects, the sound of the mechanical shutter is also reduced in volume. For further reduction in noise, Silent Mode switches the shutter from mechanical to electronic and turns all sound (AF, operation) off while suppressing the emission of the AF assist lamp and flash with just a single setting; perfect for special shooting occasions. 


Sophisticated 4K Capabilities 
With its high-speed signal readout and processing of the engine, the Lumix GX9 is capable of recording smooth, high-resolution 4K video in 3840x2160 at 30p / 25p(50Hz Area) or 24p in MP4.

The Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G80 is the successor to the Panasonic G7 and includes the same 16 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor as the G7 but with no AA filter.
The Lumix G8 also upgrades with a new Venus Engine, 2.36M dot OLED Electronic Viewfinder with increased magnification and longer eyepoint, in-body 5-axis Dual image stabilization and new in-camera focus-stacking mode. The rugged magnesium body construction is splashproof and dustproof, so it's ideal for outdoor everyday use. Easy Wireless Connectivity via Wi-Fi lets you connect with your smartphone.





Stunning clarity with every shot 
.The new LUMIX DMC-G80 features an updated Image Stabilization system â the 5-axis Dual I.S. MK II  By incorporating new gyro-sensor technology, the O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) and B.I.S. (Body Image Stabilizer, 5-axis) are able to work in perfect harmony and with outstanding accuracy. With improved suppression of blur, resulting pictures and videos remain beautifully crisp despite vibrations caused by shaking hands or traversing outdoor terrain. 


With the LUMIX DMC-G80âs ability to analyse shooting conditions, including focal length, the new Dual I.S. system is able to utilise max. 5-stop slower shutter speed . Users can also enjoy blur-free photo/video shooting in both wide angle and telephoto, even in low light situations or when shooting with one hand. 


To further minimise unwanted vibration, the LUMIX DMC-G80 also utilises an electromagnetic drive in the shutter unit. The shock caused by the movement of shutter diaphragm is dramatically reduced and shutter sound is also minimised. Together with the adoption of solid magnesium for the front panel, shutter vibration is reduced by approx. 90% compared with the DMC-G80âs predecessor, the G7.


Power to deliver the highest quality
The 16.0-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor and new Venus Engine combine to allow users to shoot vibrant, true-to-life high quality images with excellent resolution, high contrast, impressive colour reproduction and max. ISO 25600 high sensitivity.


By removing the Low Pass Filter from the DMC-G80âs sensor, the limiting resolution is improved by approx. 10%. At the same time, the Venus Engine reproduces vibrant, impressive colour â such as clear sky â by dividing hue, saturation and luminosity and finely adjusting them individually. Taking advantage of this fine tuning capability, the LUMIX G80 enables users to choose a pre-set of contrast, sharpness, saturation and noise reduction that suits their environment and shooting style.


Panasonicâs LUMIX G cameras are not only renowned for their still image quality, but also for their high quality video capability in 4K. The LUMIX DMC-G80 records stunningly smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K video in 3840x2160 at 25p (50Hz) or 24p in MP4 in addition to full-HD 1,920 x 1,080 at 50p (50 Hz) videos in AVCHD Progressive or MP4 (MPEG-4 / H.264) format with practical full-time AF.


Capture those photo opportunities 
Utilising the LUMIX DMC-G80âs exceptional 4K video recording capability, the 4K Photo function allows users to extract an 8-megapixel still with exact precision, enabling even the most fleeting moment to be caught in a still image.


Three exclusive 4K Photo functions are integrated into the LUMIX DMC-G80: 4K Burst Shooting, 4K Burst (Start/Stop) and 4K Pre-burst; all of which help allow photographers to capture and record that perfect picture by cropping the exact frame they want out from the recorded 4K video footage.


In addition to 4K Photo, the DMC-G80âs contrast AF achieves even faster and more precise focusing with digital signal communication at max. 240 fps. The Contrast AF system in the LUMIX DMC-G80 is further enhanced by Panasonicâs integration of Depth From Defocus (DFD) technology  which shortens the focusing time even further. 


Even if focus is not exactly as the user intended when the shutter is pressed, the LUMIX DMC-G80 also comes with the Post Focus function that enables users to select the specific focal point even after shooting â particularly helpful in situations like macro shooting where severe focusing is required. The camera now supports a Focus Stacking function. As taking a single macro photo with specific areas in focus can sometimes be difficult, Focus Stacking enables users to take multiple images of the same frame with different aperture values, then combine them into one image and select the area to be in focus.


In addition, Low Light AF makes it possible to set focus on the subject more precisely in extremely low-lit situations (-4EV) such as wildlife photography at dawn or dusk, while Starlight AF, allows budding astronomers to capture individual stars and constellations in the night sky.


Tough and versatile design
To withstand the demands of heavy field use, the DMC-G80 adopts rugged design with a full die-cast magnesium front frame. It also features splash and dustproof construction thanks to the careful sealing on every joint, dial and button.


To further enhance control, the LUMIX DMC-G80 comes with ergonomically-designed thick grip for a stable holding even in one hand. The front/rear dual dial system enables direct setting. For example, users can adjust white balance with a front dial and set ISO with a rear dial while choosing the shutter speed or monitoring the noise effect on the rear screen â ideal when dealing with complex lighting situations.


The DMC-G80 boasts a large 2,360K-dot OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) LVF (Live View Finder) with a magnification ratio of approx. 1.48x / 0.74x (35mm camera equiv.) and 100% field of view. It delivers high speed response with minimum time lag of less than 0.01 sec as well as 10,000:1 high contrast for exceptional visibility, plus, the eye point of approximately 20 mm offers high visibility and comfort even for users wearing glasses.


The LVF also comes with a new Power Save Mode. If the sensor detects that the eye has moved away from the LVF, the camera automatically enters sleep mode after 3, 5 or 10 seconds. When the shutter button is half pressed, it instantly switches back into shooting mode. This feature helps to increase the amount of shots that can be taken with one battery charge by almost three times, from 320 to 800-900. 


Adopting a static-type touch control system, the 3-inch (7,62cm), 1040K-dot, free-angle rear screen is easy and intuitively to control. It also tilts vertically by 270-degree, which makes shooting overhead or at low angles even easier.

The LUMIX LX15 includes the newly-developed F1.4-F2.8 LEICA DC VARIO-SUMMILUX lens system with 3x optical zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 24-72mm). The lens lets a large volume of light into the camera, enabling the high-speed shutter release to capture clear, sharp images even in low-lit situations. It also allows for beautiful bokeh, making the subject stand out for impressive photos and videos


Simple and effortless shooting of moving objects
The LUMIX LX15 brings the next era of photography to your pocket. The 1-inch MOS sensor with its 20.1-megapixel resolution realises high-quality image recording with stunning details. The MOS sensor contributes to a reduction in noise and improved S/N ratio, allowing for high-quality, high-sensitivity shots - even at ISO 12800. Whatâs more, the newly-added Random Filter granulates chromatic noise to be blended into the image more naturally.


For even faster response and greater mobility, the LUMIX LX15 features a fast, high-precision autofocus (AF) with DFD (Depth From Defocus) technology, which shortens the time to set focus. It calculates the distance to the subject by evaluating two images with different sharpness levels at 240fps.  This improvement in speed and precision is even greater as focal length increases. The LUMIX LX15 boasts high-speed burst shooting at 10 fps (AFS) / 6 fps (AFC) to capture fast-moving subjects in focus.


Experience the 4K evolution in videography/photography
Taking advantage of 4K technology, users can enjoy both 4K PHOTO and 4K VIDEO. With the 4K PHOTO capability, users can capture fleeting photo opportunities at 30 fps in 8-megapixel equivalent resolution by extracting the most photogenic frame from the 4K burst file to save as a photo. Three 4K functions are integrated to avoid missing the spur-of-the-moment action; 4K Burst Shooting, 4K Burst (Start/Stop) and 4K Pre-burst. 


The LUMIX LX15 records stunningly smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K video in 3840x2160 at 30p / 25p(50Hz Area) or 24p in MP4 in addition to the full-HD 1,920 x 1,080/ 50p videos in AVCHD Progressive or MP4 (MPEG-4 / H.264) format with practical full-time AF.


Not only that, the LUMIX LX15 also enables 4K Live Cropping in video recording â achieving stable panning and zooming. Thanks to the digital operation of the zoom lens, panning and zooming on images appears smooth because it doesnât physically move the lens. If the original footage is recorded in 4K, users can create a perfect full HD video with impressive special effects. 


Advanced macro shooting
The LUMIX LX15 excels in macro shooting capability thanks to integrating Panasonicâs cutting-edge optical/digital technologies. Stunning macro shots can be shot with a minimum working distance of 3cm (wide). 


The LUMIX LX15 comes with Post Focus, a function that enables users to select in-focus areas after shooting. Itâs helpful in situations such as macro shooting, where extreme focusing is required, or for changing the expression of the image by changing the subject in focus (simply by touching it on the cameraâs integrated screen). This is beneficial when shooting macro shots of small objects such as insects or jewellery, or when shooting facial expressions. 


Panasonic has also integrated a new Post Focus Stacking function into the LUMIX LX15, which enables users to take multiple images of the same frame with different areas in focus, then combine all or selected focus areas into one image.


Professional features in a compact body
The LUMIX LX15 is capable of shooting images in RAW and developing them in-camera. In addition to the colour space setting (sRGB/ AdobeRGB), the parameter of white balance, exposure compensation, contrast, highlight/shadow, saturation, noise reduction or sharpness can be flexibly adjusted while LUMIXâs Photo Style, Intelligent D-range Control, Intelligent Resolution can also be applied. The cameraâs two control rings for focus and aperture make it even easier for enthusiasts to manually select the ideal settings to create the perfect picture.


The LUMIX LX15 also integrates the popular Creative Control function, which features a total of 22 filter options that add fun to digital photography â exceeding the expectations of a compact camera. It is now possible to apply one of these filters even in P/A/S/M mode. Users can combine precisely the setting and filter they desire to create the optimal image.


Easy Wireless Connectivity via Wi-Fi with Smartphones
The LUMIX LX15 integrates Wi-Fi connectivity (IEEE 802.11 b/g/n) to offer a more flexible shooting experience and instant image sharing with easy operation.


5-Axis Hybrid O.I.S. +
The 5-Axis Hybrid O.I.S. + (Five Axis Optical Image Stabilizer Plus) effectively compensates for handshakes occurring in virtually any direction, enabling smooth photo and video recording.

The 24 megapixel Sony a6300 is the successor to the to the best selling a6000, and itâs a proper update: Sony has gone to town on reworking the speed, imaging and processing power hidden within this compact body.
The a6300 can focus in just 0.05 seconds â a new autofocus world record for a mirrorless camera with an APS-C sensor.


One of the standout features is called 4D Focus. The Sony a600 had 179 points of focus: the new a6300 has an astonishing 425 phase-detection focus points, distributed evenly across the whole of the cameraâs APS-C Exmor CMOS copper-wired sensor. So even if your subject ends up close to the edge of your frame, 
youâll still be able to lock onto your target. With a top speed of 11fps means youâre unlikely to miss a moment â and Sonyâs High Density Tracking feature 
claims that the AF will intelligently respond to the movement of a subject by readying the focus points nearest your target as it moves across your frame.
You can also shoot up to 8fps while youâre using Live View on the cameraâs rear screen.


if youâre more into video, thereâs plenty here to keep you occupied: 4K capture with Super 35mm format, a dedicated microphone line-in, plus Full HD at 120 fps at 100 Mbps â which is another first for Sonyâs cameras 
with APS-C sized sensors. Low-light video quality also promises to be impressive â and all that AF technology also applies to movie capture. 




0.05 sec AF speed 
The A6300 achieves the world's fastest (0.05 sec.) AF speed with the enhanced Fast Hybrid AFâs integrated autofocusing performance and the uncanny efficiency of the BIONZ X image processing engine to handle so much information with astonishing accuracy. 
 425 AF points 
With the worldâs most (425 points) focal plane phase-detection AF points helping to provide distinctively wide and dense AF point coverage, the Î±6300 focuses more accurately, efficiently and reliably on subjects throughout the frame.
 High-density Tracking AF Technology 
For supremely reliable accuracy and tracking stability, new High-density Tracking AF Technology activates AF points to cover the area around the subject with approx. 7.5 times as much density as the 6000. Only this focal plane phase-detection autofocus function can seamlessly activate AF points and track subjects moving within frame with such unerring precision.
High-speed live-view continuous shooting
Clearly capture action with high-speed continuous shooting at up to 11fps. Or choose among three speeds up to 8fps, according to the shooting situation, for live-view continuous shooting with very little lag on the EVF or LCD screen, to get the sense of immediacy of shooting with an optical viewfinder.
Superb image quality
The new 24.2 MP Exmor CMOS sensor raises the bar of imaging performance. Its copper wiring and enhanced circuitry make it possible to lower the wiring layer and boost light collection efficiency, in order to capture low-noise images with a wide sensitivity range up to ISO 51200. The use of copper raises readout speed as well as the potential of advanced 4K and Full HD 120fps shooting. 
The BIONZ X image processor works with the image sensor to provide stills and movies with more clarity and detailed texture, with less noise, especially in the mid-to-high ISO range.
4K movie recording
4K movie recording in the Super 35mm format with full pixel readout and no pixel binning allows approx. 2.4 times as much information as is basically required for 4K (QFHD: 3840 x 2160). Data this rich is, in fact, equivalent to 6K data, so it clearly conveys the ultimate resolution in 4K images.
S-Gamut/S-Log shooting
Newly employed S-Gamut/S-Log enable wide dynamic range (max. 1300%) shooting for more expressive movie-making in post-production. The Î±6300 even offers 14-stop latitude at S-Log3 setting.
 Full HD 120fps recording and Slow motion recording
You can shoot high-quality Full HD footage, even in Full HD 120fps (100fps) high-speed shooting with AF tracking at a high bit rate up to 100Mbps. Otherwise, the camera can record 4x/5x slow motion movies internally when the frame rate is set at 30p (25p) or 24p.
XGA OLED Tru-Finder
The Î±6300 introduces a high-contrast, high-resolution, high-visibility XGA OLED Tru-Finder that reproduces darkness and colour in very fine detail, as well as a mode to display images at the higher frame rate of 120fps (100fps), so you can see action smoothly and track it easily on this electronic viewfinder.
Wi-Fi/NFC /QR code functions improve connectivity with mobile devices
Wireless links via Near Field Communication (and now, via QR code, for those without NFC-enabled smartphones) make it easy to transfer image data from the Î±6300 to mobile devices.
Capture One Express (for Sony)
Capture One Express (for Sony) is one of the world's best RAW converters, rendering precise colours and incredible detail. It contains flexible digital asset management, all the essential adjustment tools and fast, responsive performance in one customizable integrated solution.

The Panasonic Lumix GX9 is a sleek and stylish  Mirrorless Camera boasting a host of great features - perfect for amateur photographers wanting a professional experience. The GX9 features a 20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor without a low-pass filter, 5-axis Dual Image Stabilisation to keep your images blur-free, a new  3-inch, 1240K-dot high resolution touch monitor, 4K video shooting and 4K Photo mode, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity and a new Monochrome filter.


20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor
The 20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor comes without a low-pass filter to ensure the greatest details are captured and an optimised gradation setting provides a wide dynamic range. Three-dimensional Colour Control detects hue, saturation levels and brightness individually and achieves the truest colour reproduction from dark to bright parts of the image - especially improving skies or human skin. 


Image Stabilisation
For greater precision, the Lumix GX9 incorporates 5-axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabiliser) for more effective suppression of blur. Combining an O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabiliser, 2-axis) and a B.I.S. (Body Image Stabiliser, 5-axis), the 5-axis Dual I.S. compensates for a larger range of movement, making it possible to use 4-stop slower shutter speed. Users can enjoy blur-free photo/video shooting from wide to tele, even in low-light situations. 


The 5-axis Dual I.S. works in both photo and motion picture recording including 4K video. Panasonic Lumix G Cameras offer a wide variety of digital interchangeable lenses and most of them comply with this 5-axis dual I.S. 


Silent Mode
To further reduce motion blur, the Lumix GX9âs shutter unit incorporates an electromagnetic drive which reduces the risk of shutter shock by approximately 90%. For street photographers who need to minimise disrupting their subjects, the sound of the mechanical shutter is also reduced in volume. For further reduction in noise, Silent Mode switches the shutter from mechanical to electronic and turns all sound (AF, operation) off while suppressing the emission of the AF assist lamp and flash with just a single setting; perfect for special shooting occasions. 


Sophisticated 4K Capabilities 
With its high-speed signal readout and processing of the engine, the Lumix GX9 is capable of recording smooth, high-resolution 4K video in 3840x2160 at 30p / 25p(50Hz Area) or 24p in MP4.

Intuitive Creativity with new Filter 
For more intuitive control, an exposure dial has been included for quick change of exposure setting. A Focus lever has also been added to the back side of the camera enabling users to change between AFS (AFF), AFC and manual focus without diving into a menu.  


For further creative freedom, Focus and Aperture Bracketing have been added. With Focus Bracketing, a maximum of 999 images can be shot with different focal distances. Aperture Bracketing lets users have multiple shots with different depth of field. Users can later choose the shot with the best focus level or most fitting depth of field characteristic. 


Also new to the Lumix GX9 is the option to shoot photos with and without creative filter options applied simultaneously. RAWs can be developed in the camera, allowing independence from access to a computer. Sophisticated modes, such as Multi exposure and Time lapse shot/ stop motion animation are also available in the Lumix GX9.


Connectivity
The Lumix GX9 integrates Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity to offer a more flexible shooting experience and instant image sharing. Once the camera is connected to a smartphone or tablet installed with Panasonic's dedicated application software Panasonic Image App for iOS / Android, users can shoot, browse and share images remotely. Compatibility with Bluetooth  (called BLE: Bluetooth Low Energy) enables constant connection with a smartphone/tablet with minimum power consumption. This enables the camera to activate by simply using a smartphone/tablet or to add GPS geotag on the photos automatically.

During viewfinder shooting, the touch Fn function offers an intuitive alternative to using the command dial or multi-selector: now you can select the focus point or adjust other important settings, like Aperture, Auto Sensitivity and more, via the large touchscreen. During image playback, a frame advance bar inherited from Nikonâs professional D5 and D500 cameras lets you quickly scroll through images. And you can pinch to zoom in and quickly trim an image.


Speed and precision
Whether youâre in the midst of the action or shooting from a distance, the D5600âs razor-sharp AF system will lock onto your subject and keep it in focus. The AF systemâs 39 focus points cover a wide area of the frame, and nine highly accurate cross-type sensors in the central area deliver enhanced accuracy. When you shoot in Live View, the cameraâs contrast-detect AF keeps you right on target. And when that perfect opportunist shot appears out of nowhere, this camera can shoot at a swift five frames per second to nail the moment with perfect precision.


Full HD Movies
Record smooth, finely detailed Full HD video clips youâll be proud to share. D-Movie enables recording at frame rates of up to 50p/60p. Continuous Live View autofocus (Full-time-servo AF mode)  keeps your subjects sharp even when the action is fast. And if you shoot with an AF-P NIKKOR kit lens, footage will be practically free of drive noise thanks to the lensâ built-in stepping motor. Time-Lapse Movie, inherited from Nikonâs advanced DSLRs, transforms scenes of slow-moving clouds, or a crowded street, into dramatic high-speed sequences. And movies shot with the D5600 are easy to share via the cameraâs SnapBridge connection.


In-camera Creative Tools
Maximize the impact of your photos and movies with a range of in-camera creative tools.

The Sony Î±7S II is a 12.2 megapixel, full-frame mirrorless camera offering ultra-high sensitivity up to an incredible ISO 409600 for both stills and video. The upgrade to the Sony Î±7S, the Î±7S II features a new 5-axis image stabilisation system to give greater control when shooting in the most challenging light conditions. The autofocus system on the Î±7S II has been upgraded and now offers 169 AF points for fast, precise focusing with low-light sensitivity to -4 EV. When shooting video, the AF performance is twice as fast as the Sony Î±7s. The Î±7S II has been designed to make it more user friendly, reliable and intuitive. 


The Î±7S II also incorporates a host of pro-style movie functions including internal UHD 4K recording at 30 fps with full pixel readout as well as 1080p recording at up to 120 fps, all in the XAVC S format.


BIONZ X Processing Engine
The upgraded image processing algorithm of BIONZ X maximises the sensorâs capabilities and improves depiction throughout the full sensitivity range with particular emphasis on the mid-to-high range. This means that the resulting stills and movies demonstrate extra-fine detail with minimal noise. 

Advanced 4K movie recording

The Î±7S II can record 4K  movies internally in the XAVC S format meaning that content is wonderfully detailed. Because information from all pixels is utilised without line skipping or pixel binning, the camera can maximise the expanded power of the full-frame image sensor and produce 4K movies with higher image clarity and negligible moirÃ©. Full pixel readout without pixel binning is also employed when shooting Full HD  movies which means that it collects information from approximately five times as many pixels that are required to generate Full HD  and condenses the information to produce extremely high quality movies.


Shoot in slow motion
the Î±7S II can record 120fps at 100Mbps  with full pixel readout without pixel binning in full frame format which can be edited into wonderful 4x/5x slow motion footage  in Full HD. The Î±7S II also has the ability to shoot 4x/5x slow motion footage internally which can be immediately reviewed on the camera screen. 



New video functionality
Video functionality has been further enhanced with new profiles; S-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3 and S-Gamut3/S-Log3. These new profiles deliver wide dynamic range and colour correction is easier to perform. The Î±7S ll even offers impressive 14-stop latitude in the S-Log3 gamma setting. The camera also supports S-Gamut/S-Log2 which is very popular among cinematographers and videographers. Gamma Display Assist is a new function that allows users to monitor images or check focus when recording S-Log movies and the Zebra function has been improved for even greater control.  


5-Axis Image Stabilisation 
The new Î±7S II is equipped with the innovative 5-axis image stabilisation system that is proving extremely popular in the Î±7 II and Î±7R II cameras. The system corrects camera shake along five axes during shooting, including angular shake (pitch and yaw) which has the greatest impact on image quality and tends to occur with a telephoto lens, shift shake (X and Y axes) which becomes noticeable as magnification increases, and rotational shake (roll) that often affects night shooting or video recording. 



Upgraded Design
A number of enhancements have been made to the look and feel of the Î±7S II to make it more user friendly, reliable and intuitive. Its magnesium-alloy body is both light and highly robust and the grip and shutter buttons have been re-designed so that the camera feels more natural in the hand. For situations when you just want to blend into the background, silent shooting mode can be activated for 5fps continuous shooting and reliability has been enhanced with reduced-vibration shutter movement. The lens mount has been further reinforced to ensure greater resilience, particularly when attaching third party lenses and users can now charge the camera via a USB power supply whilst the camera is in operation, thus extending battery life. 


Autofocus accuracy
The autofocus system on the Î±7S II has been upgraded and now offers 169 AF points for fast, precise focusing with greater accuracy.  The power of the image sensor means that the absence of noise in images generated, enables the Fast Intelligent AF to detect contrast more easily and react speedily even in low-light situations (as low as EV-4), when itâs even tough to check with the naked eye. When shooting video, the AF performance is twice as fast as the predecessor model


Electronic Viewfinder
The XGA OLED Tru-Finder in the Î±7S II has been upgraded and offers the worldâs highest viewfinder magnification  of 0.78x (roughly 38.5 degrees in diagonal field of view) and shows clear images across the entire display area. The use of ZEISS T* Coating ensures sharp reduction of reflections on the viewfinder and unlike an optical viewfinder, the OLED Tru-Finder can be used to instantly show how exposure compensation, white balance and other selected settings are affecting the displayed image.


Built-in Wi-Fi
The Î±7S II is also Wi-FiÂ® and NFC compatible and fully functional with Sonyâs PlayMemories Mobile application available for Androidâ¢ and iOSâ¢ platforms, as well as Sonyâs growing range of PlayMemories Camera Apps.

Sony FE 90mm f/2.8 Lens
This is Sony's first E-mount medium telephoto macro lens with built-in image stabilization. It delivers outstanding G Lens quality - stunning resolution at up to 1:1 magnification plus beautiful background bokeh,  even when shooting handheld. A floating focus mechanism ensures that consistently superior optical performance is achieved at all focusing distances.


Image-wide clarity from macro to infinity
A floating focus mechanism has been implemented for optimum suppression of close-focus aberration. The floating system reduces the size of the lens while maintaining outstanding clarity throughout the image area, from infinity to the closest focusing distance.


Precise, quiet focus for stills and movies
Two focus groups in a floating focus configuration are driven by an innovative DDSSM (Direct Drive Super Sonic wave Motor) system for smooth, precise positioning of the relatively heavy lenses that make full frame macro magnification possible. This system is remarkably quiet, and is ideal for animal or insect photography as well as movies.


Sharp and clear without a tripod
Although a tripod is usually considered necessary for sharp macro photography, built-in OSS (Optical SteadyShot) image stabilization makes it possible to shoot sharp macro images handheld. The heavy stabilization lens is driven by a responsive linear motor for fast, precise stabilization.


Fast auto/manual focus switching
If you have to remove your eye from the viewfinder to switch between auto and manual focus youâre likely to lose the shot. With this lens the focus ring, where your hand normally rests while shooting, simply slides back and forth to switch between manual and auto focus. A non-slip surface ensures reliable operation.


Inner focus for better handling 
In an inner focus design only internal lens elements move when focusing so the total length of the lens does not change. In addition to making handing easier, that means faster autofocus and shorter minimum focusing distance. The filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is an advantage when using a polarizing filter.


Select your focus range for faster AF
The Focus Range Limiter selector can be set for near and/or far focusing, depending on the subject, limiting focusing range and thereby maximizing autofocus speed. Selections are â ~ 0.5 metres for distant focusing, 0.5 ~ 0.28 metres for close focusing, and FULL for full-range focusing.


Great for movies as well as stills
Lens requirements for moviemaking are more demanding than for stills in some ways. Sony goes the extra mile to ensure that lenses that will be used with movie-capable cameras will deliver the necessary performance. Minimal focus breathing and quiet operation, for example, are essential for movie shooting.

This camera can take all the knocks that life can throw at it. Itâs waterproof to 10 m and shockproof to a drop of 1.8m, so thereâs no need to worry about damage from drops or dips in the pool. Itâs cold-resistant down to -10Â°C and dustproof too, letting you carry it with you anywhere without a care. You can just relax and enjoy making photography fun for everyone.


High quality images
Say goodbye to grainy shots and missed moments when you can shoot with a crystal clear NIKKOR lens and a 13.2 MP CMOS image sensor. The NIKKOR 3x optical zoom is extendable to 6x Dynamic Fine Zoom, bringing you closer to your subject so you can shoot all the fun and capture great facial expressions too. High image quality is guaranteed, helping you to shoot images and video that youâll be proud to share.


Easy sharing with Snapbridge
Your high-quality Nikon images can light up your social networks in seconds with SnapBridge. It uses BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (BLE) to maintain a constant, low-power connection between your camera and up to five smart devices. Photos can be automatically transferred to your phone or tablet as you shoot. Simply pick up your smart device and your photos will be there: images synced while you shoot are automatically re-sized so theyâre easy to review, or edit in your favourite app, and quick to upload to social media. If you donât want to automatically sync every photo, simple controls let you manually sync specific photos, transfer images at larger resolutions, and sync movies.


Full HD Video
Make great movies with friends and family at the touch of a button. Just press the dedicated video record button and youâll be shooting Full HD 1080p video with stereo sound. When the action starts youâll always be ready to record memorable moments in motion, while Electronic VR (Vibration Reduction) keeps your movies smooth. You can even play around with a Diorama effect to make your movies look like miniature scenes, and play back on your HDTV with an optional HDMI cable. Bring special celebrations and travel scenes to life in high-quality movies that are perfect for social sharing.


Easy and intuitive operation
When the actionâs happening, the last thing you want to worry about is how to operate your camera, so the COOLPIX W100 makes it easy for you. Four dedicated buttons allow direct access to the menu, while a simple-to-use interface helps you find the feature you need with ease. Buttons are large and friendly to small hands, designed to make shooting comfortable for photographers of all ages. Select Easy auto mode and your camera will optimise all its settings for you, giving you great images every time. The large 230k-dot 6.7cm/2.7in TFT LCD monitor makes framing shots easy, and its anti-reflection coating and brightness adjustment means youâll always have clear visibility â even in low light or direct sunlight. Micro-USB charging gives you a quick recharge time, so youâre always ready to capture that perfect moment.


Family friendly features
The COOLPIX W100 makes shooting simple for even the smallest of photographers with a Variety menu that gives you a choice of adult or child menus. Inside the childrenâs menu, brightly coloured Welcome screens change from day to night, according to the time of shooting. Welcome characters also appear to make shooting even more fun, and children can play with adding cartoon effects or cute stamps like hearts and stars to their images too. Your camera comes in a range of vibrant colours to suit any lifestyle.


Creative effects
Make your photos stand out with a range of effects from Highlight colors âadding a pop of colour to a black and white image â to Fisheye and Toy camera. Glamour retouch lets you give everyone a makeover with options like Mascara, Whiten teeth or Lipstick. You can even add light trails to your photos with Multiple exposure lighten or create a Slide show with sound right in your camera. Never have a dull photo day again!


Perfect portraits
Smart portrait system makes it easy to take flattering portraits of family and friends. It activates features like Face-priority AF, which automatically detects your subjectâs facial area and focuses on it. Even if your subject moves or you change the composition of your photo, it will automatically retain focus on their face. Smile mode releases the shutter when it detects your subject smiling, while Blink warning lets you know immediately if your subject blinked while your photo was taken, so you can retake the shot. Underwater face framing saves you from having to get wet when shooting poolside or at the beach, by taking underwater shots automatically when it detects peopleâs faces.


Sharp focus
Target finding AF incorporated (in Auto mode) gives you sharp focus in every image. It accurately predicts the main subject in your shot, so just by framing your image youâll achieve focus automatically. The focus area is shown on the monitor before you press the shutter, so you know exactly where the main focus of your image will be. For human subjects, faces are the priority for focus.

35mm full-frame 24.3-megapixel3 Exmorâ¢ CMOS sensor
The image sensor delivers beautiful images from corner to corner and stunning 24.3-megapixel resolution. Youâll enjoy low noise, an extremely wide dynamic range, and amazingly rich and subtle gradations. Moreover, innovations that could only be achieved by Sony reproduce details more faithfully so that every scene looks incredibly real.


5-axis image stabilization
The Î±7 II dramatically expands your range of expression by compensating for five types of camera shake during handheld shooting of still images and movies. The highly effective 4.5-step1 compensation lets you confidently zoom in faraway subjects, snap detailed close-ups, capture night scenes and more â all with minimal camera shake blur. 


High-performance Fast Hybrid AF
The newly enhanced Fast Hybrid AF system delivers extremely high-speed response, highly accurate prediction and wide area coverage for autofocusing and tracking you can always depend on. Itâs remarkably fast for a full-frame camera AF system (30% faster than the Î±7) and accurately predicts subject movement so you can steadfastly track your subject.


5fps AF/AE shooting with accurate tracking
When your subject is moving fast, you can beautifully capture the decisive moment with sharp, well-exposed results via 5fps continuous AF/AE shooting. A dramatically improved algorithm accurately predicts subject movement so you can steadfastly track the subject even when shooting continuously.


Pro-quality XAVC S format video
For extremely high image quality and minimal noise, record movies in the high-bit-rate XAVC S format, which was developed based on the professional XAVC 4K/HD format. It enables Full HD (1920 x 1080) image recording at 50Mbps (60p/50p, 30p/25p, 24p)4 and employs linear PCM sound for high-quality sound recording.


BIONZ Xâ¢ image processing engine
BIONZ X faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, via extra high-speed processing capabilities. Together with front-end Large Scale Integration that accelerates processing, it enables more natural details, more realistic images, richer tonal gradations and lower noise when shooting still images and movies.


Robust magnesium alloy body
The remarkably compact and lightweight body is solidly built to withstand the rigors of shooting in the field. Itâs the ideal blend of light weight, solid reliability and steady handling, thanks to a top cover, front cover and internal structure constructed of rigid magnesium alloy.


Enhanced grip and shutter button
The grip is refined in shape and height to support a more secure grasp of the camera even when a large lens is mounted. This also contributes to more confident operation of the shutter button and dials. Moreover, the shutter button has been reshaped and shifted forward to enable more natural shooting with less camera shake.


High-contrast, high-resolution XGA OLED Tru-Finderâ¢
The viewfinder offers impressive visibility that contributes to stress-free, intuitive operation. You can accurately monitor what will appear in your final images because it faithfully displays the effects of your various camera settings. Moreover, an advanced 3-lens optical system ensures rich tonal gradation and extremely high contrast.


Stable viewfinder image
Monitor the stabilizing effects of camera shake compensation in the viewfinder or LCD screen while shooting still images by pressing the shutter button halfway or magnifying the image, and while shooting movies by entering movie mode. Even when using a telephoto or macro lens, you can fine-tune framing and focusing with stress-free stability.


Convenient tiltable LCD screen
The LCD screen tilts upward approx. 107 degrees and downward approx. 41 degrees to accommodate wide-ranging shooting angles. This flexibility combines with compact mobility to greatly expand your shooting options. Viewing is also clear under direct sunlight thanks to WhiteMagicâ¢ technology that nearly doubles the brightness of the display.


Connect to smartphones and tablets with one touch
Instantly transfer a photo or MP4 movie to your Androidâ¢ smartphone or tablet by simply touching it with the Î±7 II â thanks to built-in Wi-Fi and NFCâ¢ (Near Field Communication)7. Touching your mobile device with the camera can also activate Smart Remote Control, which lets you control the cameraâs shutter release from your smartphone or tablet.


Anti-dust system and coating
To keep your photos blemish free, a special anti-static coating on the surface of the optical filter suppresses the attachment of both dry and moist dust particles when changing lenses. An anti-dust mechanism also vibrates at high speed when you select Cleaning Mode to remove any particles adhering to the filter.

Fifteen cross-type sensors in the centre are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses with open aperture of f/5.6 or faster, and 11 central focus points work with an open aperture of f/8.


Group Area AF
Experience enhanced subject detection and tracking. Group Area AF mode constantly monitors five different AF fields, offering improved acquisition and background isolation when shooting subjects that are comparatively small and close to a high-contrast or distracting background. The 5-point AF area can be shifted across the 51-point array as composition demands.


Fast, durable, responsive
The D810 starts up in approximately 0.12 seconds and boasts a shutter release lag of just 52 ms. The Kevlar/carbon fiberâcomposite shutter unit is tested to 200,000 releases and a shutter speed of 1/8000 to 30 s, with flash synchronisation at up to 1/250 s.

Sharp and steady
The D810âs shutter/mirror box architecture and electronic front-curtain feature ensure the sharpest possible results. The shutter/mirror mechanism reduces image shake for a steady viewfinder image with minimal blackout during high-speed shooting. When activated, the electronic front-curtain shutter reduces the risk of micro-blur in even subtle details by minimising internal vibrations during exposure.


Picture Control 2.0
Ease post-production with Flat setting for maximum dynamic range; fine-adjust detail with Clarity: Picture Control 2.0 makes it easy to define parameters so you can perfectly reflect your creative vision whether shooting stills or video.

The Olympus E-M10 Mark II combines a stylish, compact & lightweight all-metal body with advanced technology from the Olympus OM-D E-M1 and E-M5 Mark II. The upgrade to the E-M10, the E-M10 Mark II improves with a 5-axis in-body Image Stabilisation for blur-free still and movie shooting on the move. It also upgrades to a large, high-definition, high-speed 2.36M OLED Electronic Viewfinder, a tiltable 3-inch touchscreen and 4k time lapse movie capability. It offers image sharing and remote control via Wi-Fi using the Olympus OI.Share app on a Smartphone.




Amazing OM-D Image Quality
Experience the exceptional resolution and astounding detail captured by the OLYMPUS Micro Four Thirds sensor and advanced image capture technology that rival those of D-SLR cameras. Together with its highly powerful image stabiliser, this technology brings out the very best in each M.ZUIKO lens.


5-axis Image Stabilisation (IS)
5-axis Image Stabilisation eliminates the blur caused by camera-shake in virtually any shooting situation â from shift movements with macros to angular shake with telephoto lenses, or rolling at night. 5-axis IS works irrespective of the lens attached and compensates admirably for up to four steps of shutter speed. Even movies recorded one-handed come out blur-free.


Electronic Viewfinder
Even easier image composition: the OLED Electronic Viewfinder boasts an amazing 2.36M dots for ultra-clear image composition of the whole subject plus real-time monitoring of all setting adjustments â all the control and detail you need to get the most out of your photography.

The Nikon D5 is Nikon's flagship DSLR taking the top spot from the Nikon D4s. This powerhouse FX-format camera is designed to shoot action in the most demanding conditions. It boasts a newly developed 20.8MP CMOS sensor designed by Nikon and features an ISO range of 100-102400, expandable to ISO 3280,000. This will allow the Nikon D5 to capture images in near darkness and still get professional-level images. The Nikon D5 can capture 12 fps or 14 frames per second with the mirror locked up - great for professional action and wildlife photographers. 

 
The Nikon D5 certainly doesnât disappoint professionals with a strong need to capture high quailty video. It can record in a 4k resolution at 30 frames per second without needing an external recording device. Thereâs also the ability to shoot time-lapses in 4k resolution - all in-camera.  

Nikon have also made huge improvements in autofocusing. A multi-Cam 20k focusing processor allows the camera to do advanced calculations to track subjects across the frame using the 153-autofocusing points that cover large areas.

As well as the optical viewfinder for composing images thereâs also a 3.2-inch touchscreen with a 2,359,000 dot resolution.





Incredible low-light performamnce
The Nikon D5 blows the possibilities for low-light shooting wide open. With a standard ISO range of 100 to 102400, and the highest expanded sensitivity in Nikonâs history. Thanks to the cameraâs new EXPEED 5 image processing engine, image quality is unprecedentedly high across the standard ISO range. This exceptionally clean performance is made possible by a signal processing system optimised for the new sensor's 25% higher pixel count. Fine noise is dramatically reduced and even cropped images shot at high ISOs retain their quality. In an incredible feat of engineering, the ISO range can now be extended to ISO 3280000 equivalent, at the Hi 5 setting. Designed for specialist use, such as surveillance or security applications, these astonishingly high ISO counts enable colour images to be captured without a flash in astronomical twilight, which is equivalent to an amazingly low 0.001 lux.


153-Point AF and 200 NEF (RAW) Image Buffer
With an incredible 153 focus points and 99 cross-type sensors, the D5 offers exceptionally wide coverage. Whether youâre shooting the race or the red carpet, almost every situation is covered. Small subjects moving at high speed can be tracked with a new level of precision. Subjects at the edge of the frame are easily detected, and vertical shooting is vastly improved. AF sensitivity down to -4 EV (ISO 100, 20 Â°C/68 Â°F) enables superior low-light performance and all AF modes have been improved. The system is configurable in 153-point, 72-point and 25-point coverage settings in Continuous AF mode. All 153 focus points are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses with an open aperture of f/5.6 or faster, and 15 central focus points work with an effective aperture of f/8. The cameraâs high-performance buffer allows up to 200 NEF (RAW) or large JPEG images to be captured during one high-speed burst: enough to cover an entire 100 m sprint final without taking your finger off the shutter-release button.


Power and Precision
Thanks to a new AF ASIC unit, maximum computing power is allocated to AF at all times. No matter how fast the action, the camera does not compromise. Shoot at up to 12 fps with AE/AF tracking, or at up to 14 fps with mirror up. AF tracking and viewfinder visibility are vastly improved when shooting sports, or any scene in which subjects tend to change direction suddenly. Faster sequential shutter and mirror mechanisms significantly reduce viewfinder blackout during high-speed bursts. For ultimate precision, pair the D5 with a professional NIKKOR lens equipped with SPORT VR mode, such as the AF-S NIKKOR 600mm f/4E or the AF-S NIKKOR 500mm f/4E. SPORT VR mode also delivers a stable viewfinder image when tracking high-speed movement. Combine the D5 with one of these lenses and youâll capture fast-moving, unpredictable subjects with unprecedented smoothness.


Image Sensor and Metering
The all-new 20.8 MP FX-format CMOS image sensor and 180K-pixel RGB metering sensor deliver phenomenally accurate subject recognition and image detail. Even if youâre shooting fast sports indoors, this camera will get you the shot. And not just any shot: tonal gradations are richer and more accurate. The D5 also boasts a new 8.0 cm (3.2 in.), 2360k-dot LCD monitor, which offers touch operation in review mode. With a level of responsiveness comparable to smartphones, this high-resolution screen means you can easily check and select key images on the spot. Shoot in Live View and you can use touch operation to change the focus point, or acquire preset Spot White Balance data, based on the selected area within the frame. For even greater control, Picture Control 2.0 makes it easy to define parameters whether youâre shooting stills or video. Ease post-production with the Flat pre-setting for maximum dynamic range; fine-adjust detail with Clarity.


4K High-Definition D-Movies
4K movies (3840x2160 pixels) can be recorded at 30p/25p/24p in dot-by-dot native pixel crop, which ensures the highest image quality. When shooting Full HD (1080p) video, you can record at frame rates up to 50p/60p in multiple sensor crop formats, including native Full HD pixel crop. When filming in M mode, sensitivity for all video resolutions and crop modes can be set from ISO 100 all the way up to Hi 5. Auto ISO allows ISO 200 up to Hi 5, and lets you configure the maximum ISO settings you want to work with. The camera offers clean HDMI out: even 4K movies can be recorded to the in-camera memory card or output uncompressed to HDMI with 8-bit 4:2:2 YCbCr. HDMI output is available for all movie resolutions during remote shooting.


High-speed image captur fast data transfer
This camera reduces the stress factors that come with the demands of professional photography. Ergonomically, improvements include buttons with more defined ridges and curves, which enable more intuitive control, especially when shooting through the viewfinder. New double XQD card slots easily handle the D5âs incredible capacity to shoot up to 200 NEF (RAW) images in one burst, and ensure the buffer is instantly cleared for the next burst. A new USB 3.0 port enables high-speed transfer of large amounts of data, and wireless and Ethernet connection is now 2x faster.

Pentax has also drastically improved the cameraâs noise-reduction performance at a high-sensitivity range â up to ISO 819200 â to expand creative possibilities in super-high-sensitivity shooting.


Pixel Shift Resolution System II
features the Pixel Shift Resolution System II, which obtains RGB colour data for each pixel to produce super-high-resolution images with finer details and more truthful colours than those produced by ordinary full-frame sensors. In the new Dynamic Pixel Shift Resolution mode, which can be used during handheld shooting, this system can be used jointly with the cameraâs shake-reduction mechanism, since it synthesizes the captured super-high-resolution images by detecting the slight fluctuations of the subjectâs position during continuous shooting. The camera also provides ON/OFF switching of the Motion Correction function, which detects moving elements of the continuously captured images to minimize the effect of movement during the image synthesizing process.


High-performance five-axis, five-step SR II system
The PENTAX K-1 Mark II comes equipped with the PENTAX-developed SR II (Shake Reduction II) five-axis mechanism, which provides accurate control of the large full-frame image sensor with all compatible PENTAX interchangeable lenses. In addition to camera shake caused by pitch and yaw, this advanced system also compensates for camera shake caused by horizontal and vertical shift (often generated in macro photography) and camera shake caused by roll, which is difficult for lens-installed shake reduction mechanisms to handle. It has a compensation range up to five shutter steps (measured in conformity with CIPA standards, using the HD PENTAX-D FA 28-105mm F3.5-5, 6ED DC WR at a 105mm focal length). When taking a panning shot, this system automatically detects the direction of the cameraâs movement, and efficiently controls the SR unit to produce the best image possible without requiring any mode switching operation.


Innovative AA filter simulator
By applying microscopic vibrations to the image sensor unit at the sub-pixel level during image exposure, the cameraâs anti-aliasing (AA) filter simulator provides the same level of moirÃ© reduction as an optical AA filter. Unlike an optical filter, which always creates the identical result, this innovative simulator not only lets the user switch the AA filter effect on and off, but also adjust the level of the effect. This means that the ideal effect can be set for a particular scene or subject based on given photographic conditions.


Flexible tilt-type LCD monitor
The K-1 mark II features a flexible tilt-type LCD monitor, which can be tilted to the desired angle horizontally, vertically or diagonally with a single action, without deviating from the lensâs optical axis. The user can not only tilt it approximately 35 degrees horizontally and approximately 44 degrees vertically, but also pull it out from its base to view the on-screen image from above for waist-level photography. This large, 3.2-inch LCD monitor has approximately 1,037,000 dots and a 3:2 aspect ratio, and provides a protective tempered-glass front panel for added durability. In addition to its wide-view design, it also features a unique air-gapless construction, in which the air space between LCD layers is eliminated to effectively reduce the reflection and dispersion of light for improved visibility during outdoor shooting. Its outdoor monitor function, which allows instant adjustment of the monitorâs brightness to the desired level, has also been improved to provide greater visibility in dark locations. Its red-lit monitor display function facilitates monitor viewing when the photographerâs eyes have become accustomed to a dark location during night-time photography.


Easy-to-focus optical viewfinder
Optimized for a 35mm full-frame digital SLR design, the cameraâs optical viewfinder provides a nearly 100-percent field of view and an approximately 0.7-times magnification. Thanks to the combination of a condenser lens and aspherical lens, it provides a wide field of view and a clear, undistorted image of the subject. It comes with a Natural Bright Matt III focusing screen, acclaimed for ease of focusing during manual-focus operation, and true-to-life rendition of defocused areas in the viewfinder image. In addition, its transparent viewfinder display makes it possible to superimpose a wide range of photographic data over the viewfinder image.

SAFOX 12 with 33 sensor points and full-frame-proportioned AF frame
Thanks to the SAFOX 12 AF sensor module with 33 AF sensors (25 cross-type sensors positioned in the middle), the PENTAX K-1 Mark II optimizes the autofocus process, and assures high-speed autofocus operation in the AF.S (AF Single) mode. The center sensor and two sensors located just above and below it are designed to detect the light flux of an F2.8 lens, making it easy to obtain pinpoint focus on a subject when using a large-aperture lens. Its AF Tracking algorithm has also been revised to improve tracking accuracy of fast-moving subjects in the AF.C (AF Continuous) mode.


Pentax Real-Time Scene Analysis System 
By combining an approximately 86,000-pixel RGB metering sensor with the high-performance PRIME IV imaging engine, the PENTAX K-1 Mark IIâs advanced PENTAX Real-Time Scene Analysis System performs real-time analysis of the brightness distribution over the image field and the subjectâs colours and movement. Based on this data, it then measures the subjectâs lighting conditions with great accuracy and optimizes the exposure. By adopting a breakthrough artificial intelligence technology, deep learning, to its algorithm, it assesses each individual scene more accurately, and optimizes the exposure settings for a given scene or composition.


Compact, solid body with dustproof, weather-resistant construction
The cameraâs bottom panel and front and back frames are all made of sturdy yet lightweight magnesium alloy. Although the camera features a dependable, durable shutter unit that can withstand 300,000 shutter releases (measured under actual shooting conditions) for professional use, its body has been downsized to the minimum possible, thanks to the incorporation of a unique floating mirror structure. With the inclusion of 87 sealing parts in the body, the camera also boasts a dustproof, weather-resistant and cold-resistant construction, assuring solid operation at temperatures as low as -10Â°C. 


Full HD movie recording
The PENTAX K-1 Mark II captures Full HDmovie clips (1920 x 1080 pixels; 60i/30p frame rate) in the H.264 recording format, and comes equipped with a stereo mic terminal for external microphone connection, and a headphone terminal. The user can also adjust the audio recording level manually, monitor sound pressure levels during microphone recording, and cut down wind noise using a new wind-noise reduction mode. In addition to a host of distinctive visual effects for movie recording,* the camera also provides the interval movie mode, which captures a series of 4K-resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) movie clips at a fixed interval.


Built-in GPS module
Thanks to its built-in GPS module, the PENTAX K-1 Mark II provides a variety of advanced GPS functions, including the recording of location, latitude, longitude, altitude and UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) and direction at the time of shooting. The user can easily access images containing GPS data using a computer, to browse them, check on shooting locations and position data on the screen, or save them.
The camera also provides a set of other unique tools, including: Electronic Compass, which displays the camera's direction on its LCD monitor; GPS log, which keeps track of the photographer's movement; and ASTRO TRACER, which simplifies the tracing and photographing of celestial bodies by coupling GPS data with the camera's SR mechanism.

The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is a tough, compact and lightweight 16 megapixel Interchangeable Lens Camera and  is the successor to the award winning OM-D E-M5. The E-M5 Mark II boasts the worldâs most powerful IS 5-axis in-body Image Stabilization system (as of December 2014)  for blur-free video and still shooting without a tripod.
It's equivalent to 5 steps faster shutter speed - that translates to startling low-light image quality. The Olympus E-M5 II also includes a 40 megapixel, high-res composite shot function for incredible still images. 


A new OM-D Movie Mode offers multiple video frame rates and Full HD video up to 77 Mbps while an ergonomic, user friendly design makes the E-M5 Mark II simple to use. With a 3-inch vari-angle LCD touchscreen and large electronic viewfinder, you'll get a crystal-clear view of any shooting situation. The built-in Wi-Fi enables remote shooting and easy sharing of your images via a smartphone.


Unique 5-axis Image Stabilisation (IS) systemThe Olympus E-M5 Mark II features the worldâs most powerful 5-axis Image Stabilisation system. The new, evolved eliminates camera-shake in all five planes of movement, achieving the equivalent of 5 EV steps faster shutter speed. Plus, itâs built into the body of the camera, so it works with any lens. Even in low-light conditions and with a telephoto lens, 5-axis IS ensures the E-M5 shoots blur-free. That goes for video and stills.


Solid, Ergonomic design
The magnesium alloy housing feels reassuringly solid and stable whilst being compact & lightweight. The E-M5 is dustproof splash- and freezeproof so it's ideal for the outdoors. 


The OM-D E-M5 Mark II comes with intelligently laid-out controls that simplify access to the vast array of options. That means attention to design details, both large and small. For instance, the Fn buttons on the top of the E-M5 Mark II and the function dial that protrudes slightly higher than usual.


Outstanding video
In OM-D Movie Mode, the Mark II records at high bitrates up to 77 Mbps, and offers a wide variety of 1080 Full HD formats to match your frame rate of choice â 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p or the classic 24p preferred by many narrative filmmakers. Focusing during video capture is straightforward, via a 3-inch touch-sensitive, vari-angle LCD screen.


Vari-angle touchscreen display & EVF
When youâre shooting from awkward angles, this 1.04 million-dot vari-angle display can swivel and tilt to ensure a bright and clear view of any scene. Equally advantageous is the large, bright, 2.36 million-dot Electronic Viewfinder that automatically switches on when it detects your eye. It reveals a clearly laid-out menu of key settings than can be adjusted before you release the shutter.


40 Megapixel stills 
Another advantage of Olympusâ ultra-precise 5-axis stabilisation system is the potential to capture extremely high-resolution still images that exceed the normal capacity of its 16-Megapixel LIVE MOS sensor. By moving the sensor by 0.5 pixel steps between each shot and merging eight single exposures into one, the E-M5 Mark II delivers a 40-Megapixel image with breathtaking levels of detail and radiance. Little wonder OM-D is known for the best images Olympus cameras have ever created. Another key component in this spectacular visual performance is the processing engine. The  E-M5 Mark II now uses the same TruePic VII processor as the top-of-the-range OM-D E-M1. 


Effects and features
Although remarkably small and easy to handle, the E-M5 Mark II is packed with clever options that urge you to let your creativity off the leash. Live Composite, which combines several images in the camera, is ideal for passage-of-time shots that trace the movement of bright objects such as stars, fireworks or handheld light-painting devices. Alternatively, shoot burst sequences at 10fps and take advantage of a 1/16000 shutter speed. In-camera keystone compensation allows for correcting converging verticals in Live View, without the need for a shift lens or post-processing. With a host of art filters, you can add a layer of special effects while built-in WiFi means you can remote control the Mark II from a smartphone, then share and geotag the images on social media using Olympus OI.Share â an invaluable facility in a variety of shooting situations. These are just a few highlights from a long list of enhancements that make the next-gen E-M5 one of the most versatile and ergonomically sophisticated cameras in the category.

The 24 megapixel Sony a6300 is the successor to the to the best selling a6000, and itâs a proper update: Sony has gone to town on reworking the speed, imaging and processing power hidden within this compact body.
The a6300 can focus in just 0.05 seconds â a new autofocus world record for a mirrorless camera with an APS-C sensor.


One of the standout features is called 4D Focus. The Sony a600 had 179 points of focus: the new a6300 has an astonishing 425 phase-detection focus points, distributed evenly across the whole of the cameraâs APS-C Exmor CMOS copper-wired sensor. So even if your subject ends up close to the edge of your frame, 
youâll still be able to lock onto your target. With a top speed of 11fps means youâre unlikely to miss a moment â and Sonyâs High Density Tracking feature 
claims that the AF will intelligently respond to the movement of a subject by readying the focus points nearest your target as it moves across your frame.
You can also shoot up to 8fps while youâre using Live View on the cameraâs rear screen.


if youâre more into video, thereâs plenty here to keep you occupied: 4K capture with Super 35mm format, a dedicated microphone line-in, plus Full HD at 120 fps at 100 Mbps â which is another first for Sonyâs cameras 
with APS-C sized sensors. Low-light video quality also promises to be impressive â and all that AF technology also applies to movie capture. 




0.05 sec AF speed 
The A6300 achieves the world's fastest (0.05 sec.) AF speed with the enhanced Fast Hybrid AFâs integrated autofocusing performance and the uncanny efficiency of the BIONZ X image processing engine to handle so much information with astonishing accuracy. 
 425 AF points 
With the worldâs most (425 points) focal plane phase-detection AF points helping to provide distinctively wide and dense AF point coverage, the Î±6300 focuses more accurately, efficiently and reliably on subjects throughout the frame.
 High-density Tracking AF Technology 
For supremely reliable accuracy and tracking stability, new High-density Tracking AF Technology activates AF points to cover the area around the subject with approx. 7.5 times as much density as the 6000. Only this focal plane phase-detection autofocus function can seamlessly activate AF points and track subjects moving within frame with such unerring precision.
High-speed live-view continuous shooting
Clearly capture action with high-speed continuous shooting at up to 11fps. Or choose among three speeds up to 8fps, according to the shooting situation, for live-view continuous shooting with very little lag on the EVF or LCD screen, to get the sense of immediacy of shooting with an optical viewfinder.
Superb image quality
The new 24.2 MP Exmor CMOS sensor raises the bar of imaging performance. Its copper wiring and enhanced circuitry make it possible to lower the wiring layer and boost light collection efficiency, in order to capture low-noise images with a wide sensitivity range up to ISO 51200. The use of copper raises readout speed as well as the potential of advanced 4K and Full HD 120fps shooting. 
The BIONZ X image processor works with the image sensor to provide stills and movies with more clarity and detailed texture, with less noise, especially in the mid-to-high ISO range.
4K movie recording
4K movie recording in the Super 35mm format with full pixel readout and no pixel binning allows approx. 2.4 times as much information as is basically required for 4K (QFHD: 3840 x 2160). Data this rich is, in fact, equivalent to 6K data, so it clearly conveys the ultimate resolution in 4K images.
S-Gamut/S-Log shooting
Newly employed S-Gamut/S-Log enable wide dynamic range (max. 1300%) shooting for more expressive movie-making in post-production. The Î±6300 even offers 14-stop latitude at S-Log3 setting.
 Full HD 120fps recording and Slow motion recording
You can shoot high-quality Full HD footage, even in Full HD 120fps (100fps) high-speed shooting with AF tracking at a high bit rate up to 100Mbps. Otherwise, the camera can record 4x/5x slow motion movies internally when the frame rate is set at 30p (25p) or 24p.
XGA OLED Tru-Finder
The Î±6300 introduces a high-contrast, high-resolution, high-visibility XGA OLED Tru-Finder that reproduces darkness and colour in very fine detail, as well as a mode to display images at the higher frame rate of 120fps (100fps), so you can see action smoothly and track it easily on this electronic viewfinder.
Wi-Fi/NFC /QR code functions improve connectivity with mobile devices
Wireless links via Near Field Communication (and now, via QR code, for those without NFC-enabled smartphones) make it easy to transfer image data from the Î±6300 to mobile devices.
Capture One Express (for Sony)
Capture One Express (for Sony) is one of the world's best RAW converters, rendering precise colours and incredible detail. It contains flexible digital asset management, all the essential adjustment tools and fast, responsive performance in one customizable integrated solution.

Features include the Sony Bionz X processor, 3-inch tilting monitor, Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity and 1080/60p video recording - now with XAVC S.





35mm full-frame 24.3-megapixel3 Exmorâ¢ CMOS sensor
The image sensor delivers beautiful images from corner to corner and stunning 24.3-megapixel resolution. Youâll enjoy low noise, an extremely wide dynamic range, and amazingly rich and subtle gradations. Moreover, innovations that could only be achieved by Sony reproduce details more faithfully so that every scene looks incredibly real.


5-axis image stabilization
The Î±7 II dramatically expands your range of expression by compensating for five types of camera shake during handheld shooting of still images and movies. The highly effective 4.5-step1 compensation lets you confidently zoom in faraway subjects, snap detailed close-ups, capture night scenes and more â all with minimal camera shake blur. 


High-performance Fast Hybrid AF
The newly enhanced Fast Hybrid AF system delivers extremely high-speed response, highly accurate prediction and wide area coverage for autofocusing and tracking you can always depend on. Itâs remarkably fast for a full-frame camera AF system (30% faster than the Î±7) and accurately predicts subject movement so you can steadfastly track your subject.


5fps AF/AE shooting with accurate tracking
When your subject is moving fast, you can beautifully capture the decisive moment with sharp, well-exposed results via 5fps continuous AF/AE shooting. A dramatically improved algorithm accurately predicts subject movement so you can steadfastly track the subject even when shooting continuously.


Pro-quality XAVC S format video
For extremely high image quality and minimal noise, record movies in the high-bit-rate XAVC S format, which was developed based on the professional XAVC 4K/HD format.

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is a tough, compact and lightweight 16 megapixel Interchangeable Lens Camera and  is the successor to the award winning OM-D E-M5. The E-M5 Mark II boasts the worldâs most powerful IS 5-axis in-body Image Stabilization system (as of December 2014)  for blur-free video and still shooting without a tripod.
It's equivalent to 5 steps faster shutter speed - that translates to startling low-light image quality. The Olympus E-M5 II also includes a 40 megapixel, high-res composite shot function for incredible still images. 


A new OM-D Movie Mode offers multiple video frame rates and Full HD video up to 77 Mbps while an ergonomic, user friendly design makes the E-M5 Mark II simple to use. With a 3-inch vari-angle LCD touchscreen and large electronic viewfinder, you'll get a crystal-clear view of any shooting situation. The built-in Wi-Fi enables remote shooting and easy sharing of your images via a smartphone.


Unique 5-axis Image Stabilisation (IS) systemThe Olympus E-M5 Mark II features the worldâs most powerful 5-axis Image Stabilisation system. The new, evolved eliminates camera-shake in all five planes of movement, achieving the equivalent of 5 EV steps faster shutter speed. Plus, itâs built into the body of the camera, so it works with any lens. Even in low-light conditions and with a telephoto lens, 5-axis IS ensures the E-M5 shoots blur-free. That goes for video and stills.


Solid, Ergonomic design
The magnesium alloy housing feels reassuringly solid and stable whilst being compact & lightweight. The E-M5 is dustproof splash- and freezeproof so it's ideal for the outdoors. 


The OM-D E-M5 Mark II comes with intelligently laid-out controls that simplify access to the vast array of options. That means attention to design details, both large and small. For instance, the Fn buttons on the top of the E-M5 Mark II and the function dial that protrudes slightly higher than usual.


Outstanding video
In OM-D Movie Mode, the Mark II records at high bitrates up to 77 Mbps, and offers a wide variety of 1080 Full HD formats to match your frame rate of choice â 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p or the classic 24p preferred by many narrative filmmakers. Focusing during video capture is straightforward, via a 3-inch touch-sensitive, vari-angle LCD screen.


Vari-angle touchscreen display & EVF
When youâre shooting from awkward angles, this 1.04 million-dot vari-angle display can swivel and tilt to ensure a bright and clear view of any scene. Equally advantageous is the large, bright, 2.36 million-dot Electronic Viewfinder that automatically switches on when it detects your eye. It reveals a clearly laid-out menu of key settings than can be adjusted before you release the shutter.


40 Megapixel stills 
Another advantage of Olympusâ ultra-precise 5-axis stabilisation system is the potential to capture extremely high-resolution still images that exceed the normal capacity of its 16-Megapixel LIVE MOS sensor. By moving the sensor by 0.5 pixel steps between each shot and merging eight single exposures into one, the E-M5 Mark II delivers a 40-Megapixel image with breathtaking levels of detail and radiance. Little wonder OM-D is known for the best images Olympus cameras have ever created. Another key component in this spectacular visual performance is the processing engine. The  E-M5 Mark II now uses the same TruePic VII processor as the top-of-the-range OM-D E-M1. 


Effects and features
Although remarkably small and easy to handle, the E-M5 Mark II is packed with clever options that urge you to let your creativity off the leash. Live Composite, which combines several images in the camera, is ideal for passage-of-time shots that trace the movement of bright objects such as stars, fireworks or handheld light-painting devices. Alternatively, shoot burst sequences at 10fps and take advantage of a 1/16000 shutter speed. In-camera keystone compensation allows for correcting converging verticals in Live View, without the need for a shift lens or post-processing. With a host of art filters, you can add a layer of special effects while built-in WiFi means you can remote control the Mark II from a smartphone, then share and geotag the images on social media using Olympus OI.Share â an invaluable facility in a variety of shooting situations. These are just a few highlights from a long list of enhancements that make the next-gen E-M5 one of the most versatile and ergonomically sophisticated cameras in the category.

Later, to relive the fun that's been captured in the footage, use Sony PlayMemories Home software to recall journeys, wherever on Earth you shot them on camera. With Map View mode, the path and images of a journey appear on a trail map.


OLED Tru-Finder improves the view
The compact, high-contrast OLED Tru-Finder displays real-time preview and various shooting information, so that what you see onscreen is exactly what you'll get in your shot; and is retractable for portability, safety and practicality.


180-degree tiltable LCD monitor for easy framing
The high-resolution LCD on the camera back can be tilted up to 180 degrees. So when you're in front of the camera, you can easily view the LCD to check the framing before you shoot a selfie, for example. This flexibility also lets you comfortably maintain stress-free posture while monitoring a scene that you want to shoot from a low angle.


Fast Wi-Fi/NFCâ¢ connection simplifies sharing
You can use built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) to make a quick connection via Wi-Fi with Android mobile devices. Then, you can share favourite photos and movies within moments by sending them directly from the camera to the smartphones and tablets 2 of friends and family members. Downloading PlayMemories Mobile onto your mobile device enables you to control the camera remotely.


More flexible movie formats
The new XAVC S 3 format captures movies detailing extra-smooth action and high-quality sound with great fidelity to the original sources. Whether youâre shooting in XAVC S or high-definition AVCHD format, you can also simultaneously record another version of the same scene in a compressed, web-friendly MP4 format for convenient sharing.



Control ring and grip take hold
For fuller-scale operability, you can assign frequently used manual focus, step zoom, quick zoom and other functions to the control ring around the circumference of the lens in front, then access and use those functions instantly as needed when shooting. Moreover, the camera grip has been ergonomically designed for optimal handling stability at all times.


Intelligent Active Mode keeps blur away
Have no fear of handheld movie shooting. Intelligent Active Mode, featuring Sony's advanced frame-analysis technology and 5-axis 4 image stabilisation, compensates for camera shake. This mode reduces the blurriness that tends to occur in images when shooting handheld or shooting while chasing a subject in action.


P/A/S/M exposure modes 
Put your creative intentions in motion with Programmed AE (P)/Aperture priority (A)/Shutter-speed priority (S)/Manual (M) exposure modes. These modes provide you with all the flexibility that you need to manually control exposure and adjust background blur in order to capture the image that you're looking for.


Customisable settings
Assign frequently used functions (Focus mode, White Balance, Picture Effect, etc.) to customisable buttons and keys for easier, quicker access to such functions while shooting. For example, you can assign 12 functions to the Function button, then press it, choose a function, and adjust function parameters via the control ring or rear control wheel.


Extra-speedy & precise Fast Intelligent AF
An improved spatial object detection algorithm realises a more optimal and accurate lens drive to make AF even faster, for capturing more fleeting moments with ease.


Digital level gauge for even framing
The camera's digital level gauge uses easy-to-read graphics to indicate clearly whether the camera is level and enables fine adjustment of horizontal alignment during shooting. It's useful for avoiding the occurrence of camera roll, to help ensure that your shots look steady and well-framed.


PlayMemories Camera Apps 
Enhance your creative expression with PlayMemories Camera Apps, offering a growing range of enjoyable applications that are easy to download. Not only do these apps give you greater functionality â they are the ultimate means of personalising your camera to fulfill your photographic aims.

Perfect portraits
Smart portrait system makes it easy to take flattering portraits of family and friends. It activates features like Face-priority AF, which automatically detects your subjectâs facial area and focuses on it. Even if your subject moves or you change the composition of your photo, it will automatically retain focus on their face. Smile mode releases the shutter when it detects your subject smiling, while Blink warning lets you know immediately if your subject blinked while your photo was taken, so you can retake the shot. Underwater face framing saves you from having to get wet when shooting poolside or at the beach, by taking underwater shots automatically when it detects peopleâs faces.


Sharp focus
Target finding AF incorporated (in Auto mode) gives you sharp focus in every image. It accurately predicts the main subject in your shot, so just by framing your image youâll achieve focus automatically. The focus area is shown on the monitor before you press the shutter, so you know exactly where the main focus of your image will be. For human subjects, faces are the priority for focus.

The highly effective 4.5-step1 compensation lets you confidently zoom in faraway subjects, snap detailed close-ups, capture night scenes and more â all with minimal camera shake blur. 


High-performance Fast Hybrid AF
The newly enhanced Fast Hybrid AF system delivers extremely high-speed response, highly accurate prediction and wide area coverage for autofocusing and tracking you can always depend on. Itâs remarkably fast for a full-frame camera AF system (30% faster than the Î±7) and accurately predicts subject movement so you can steadfastly track your subject.


5fps AF/AE shooting with accurate tracking
When your subject is moving fast, you can beautifully capture the decisive moment with sharp, well-exposed results via 5fps continuous AF/AE shooting. A dramatically improved algorithm accurately predicts subject movement so you can steadfastly track the subject even when shooting continuously.


Pro-quality XAVC S format video
For extremely high image quality and minimal noise, record movies in the high-bit-rate XAVC S format, which was developed based on the professional XAVC 4K/HD format. It enables Full HD (1920 x 1080) image recording at 50Mbps (60p/50p, 30p/25p, 24p)4 and employs linear PCM sound for high-quality sound recording.


BIONZ Xâ¢ image processing engine
BIONZ X faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, via extra high-speed processing capabilities. Together with front-end Large Scale Integration that accelerates processing, it enables more natural details, more realistic images, richer tonal gradations and lower noise when shooting still images and movies.


Robust magnesium alloy body
The remarkably compact and lightweight body is solidly built to withstand the rigors of shooting in the field. Itâs the ideal blend of light weight, solid reliability and steady handling, thanks to a top cover, front cover and internal structure constructed of rigid magnesium alloy.


Enhanced grip and shutter button
The grip is refined in shape and height to support a more secure grasp of the camera even when a large lens is mounted. This also contributes to more confident operation of the shutter button and dials. Moreover, the shutter button has been reshaped and shifted forward to enable more natural shooting with less camera shake.


High-contrast, high-resolution XGA OLED Tru-Finderâ¢
The viewfinder offers impressive visibility that contributes to stress-free, intuitive operation. You can accurately monitor what will appear in your final images because it faithfully displays the effects of your various camera settings. Moreover, an advanced 3-lens optical system ensures rich tonal gradation and extremely high contrast.


Stable viewfinder image
Monitor the stabilizing effects of camera shake compensation in the viewfinder or LCD screen while shooting still images by pressing the shutter button halfway or magnifying the image, and while shooting movies by entering movie mode. Even when using a telephoto or macro lens, you can fine-tune framing and focusing with stress-free stability.


Convenient tiltable LCD screen
The LCD screen tilts upward approx. 107 degrees and downward approx. 41 degrees to accommodate wide-ranging shooting angles. This flexibility combines with compact mobility to greatly expand your shooting options. Viewing is also clear under direct sunlight thanks to WhiteMagicâ¢ technology that nearly doubles the brightness of the display.


Connect to smartphones and tablets with one touch
Instantly transfer a photo or MP4 movie to your Androidâ¢ smartphone or tablet by simply touching it with the Î±7 II â thanks to built-in Wi-Fi and NFCâ¢ (Near Field Communication)7. Touching your mobile device with the camera can also activate Smart Remote Control, which lets you control the cameraâs shutter release from your smartphone or tablet.


Anti-dust system and coating
To keep your photos blemish free, a special anti-static coating on the surface of the optical filter suppresses the attachment of both dry and moist dust particles when changing lenses. An anti-dust mechanism also vibrates at high speed when you select Cleaning Mode to remove any particles adhering to the filter.

This means that the resulting stills and movies demonstrate extra-fine detail with minimal noise. 

Advanced 4K movie recording
The Î±7S II can record 4K  movies internally in the XAVC S format meaning that content is wonderfully detailed. Because information from all pixels is utilised without line skipping or pixel binning, the camera can maximise the expanded power of the full-frame image sensor and produce 4K movies with higher image clarity and negligible moirÃ©. Full pixel readout without pixel binning is also employed when shooting Full HD  movies which means that it collects information from approximately five times as many pixels that are required to generate Full HD  and condenses the information to produce extremely high quality movies.

In a first for a DSLR, the D810âs ISO range starts at ISO 64 for cleaner, better-defined images. Shoot at up to ISO 12800, or extend the range from 32 to 51200 ISO (equivalent).


Multi-area D-Movie
For moviemaking in diverse conditions, D-Movie offers broadcast-quality video in multiple frame formats. The D810 records Full HD (1080p) movies in FX and DX formats at 50p/60p frame rates with markedly reduced noise, moirÃ©, and false colour. It offers clean HDMI out, plus simultaneous capture of full-resolution footage in-camera and on an external recorder.


Moviemaking freedom
Take complete control over footage while filming. You can set sensitivity from ISO 64 all the way up to ISO 51200 (equivalent) in M mode, and the Auto ISO function lets you configure the maximum ISO settings you want to work with. Nikonâs 3D noise reduction reduces random noise, distortion, and flicker when filming at high sensitivities. Zebra mode shows you exactly where highlights are blown on the camera monitor.


High-fidelity audio controlsuperior audio control improves sound recording and offers greater overall flexibility. A stereo microphone input and an audio out let you fine-tune audio levels in isolation both before and during recording. You can select the sound range (wide/voice), and wind noise can be reduced when recording with the built-in microphone.


Flagship AF performance
Boasting the same AF system as Nikonâs D4S, the D810 delivers the ultimate in high-resolution precision. Offers fast acquisition and improved background isolation even in challenging lighting conditions with the new Group Area AF mode.


Multi-CAM 3500FX 51-point AF system
Fine-tuned for ultra-high resolution images. Configurable in 9-point, 21-point, and 51-point coverage settings and sensitive down to -2 EV (ISO 100, 20 Â°C/68 Â°F). Advancements include improved lock-on, expanded âstore by orientation,â and options for AF mode restrictions. Fifteen cross-type sensors in the centre are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses with open aperture of f/5.6 or faster, and 11 central focus points work with an open aperture of f/8.


Group Area AF
Experience enhanced subject detection and tracking. Group Area AF mode constantly monitors five different AF fields, offering improved acquisition and background isolation when shooting subjects that are comparatively small and close to a high-contrast or distracting background. The 5-point AF area can be shifted across the 51-point array as composition demands.


Fast, durable, responsive
The D810 starts up in approximately 0.12 seconds and boasts a shutter release lag of just 52 ms. The Kevlar/carbon fiberâcomposite shutter unit is tested to 200,000 releases and a shutter speed of 1/8000 to 30 s, with flash synchronisation at up to 1/250 s.

173,jessops-e37daa214ec842c576aa31d5586581ee,'Nikon D5 Digital SLR Body with AF-S NIKKOR 200â500mm f/5.6E ED VR Lens','Digital SLRs',pound,6319.00,'Nikon',,True,"Nikon D5 Digital SLR Body with AF-S NIKKOR 200â500mm f/5.6E ED VR Lens 
The Nikon D5 is Nikon's flagship DSLR taking the top spot from the Nikon D4s. This powerhouse FX-format camera is designed to shoot action in the most demanding conditions. It boasts a newly developed 20.8MP CMOS sensor designed by Nikon and features an ISO range of 100-102400, expandable to ISO 3280,000. This will allow the Nikon D5 to capture images in near darkness and still get professional-level images. The Nikon D5 can capture 12 fps or 14 frames per second with the mirror locked up - great for professional action and wildlife photographers. 

 
The Nikon D5 certainly doesnât disappoint professionals with a strong need to capture high quailty video. It can record in a 4k resolution at 30 frames per second without needing an external recording device. Thereâs also the ability to shoot time-lapses in 4k resolution - all in-camera.  

Nikon have also made huge improvements in autofocusing. A multi-Cam 20k focusing processor allows the camera to do advanced calculations to track subjects across the frame using the 153-autofocusing points that cover large areas.

As well as the optical viewfinder for composing images thereâs also a 3.2-inch touchscreen with a 2,359,000 dot resolution.





Incredible low-light performamnce
The Nikon D5 blows the possibilities for low-light shooting wide open. With a standard ISO range of 100 to 102400, and the highest expanded sensitivity in Nikonâs history. Thanks to the cameraâs new EXPEED 5 image processing engine, image quality is unprecedentedly high across the standard ISO range. This exceptionally clean performance is made possible by a signal processing system optimised for the new sensor's 25% higher pixel count. Fine noise is dramatically reduced and even cropped images shot at high ISOs retain their quality. In an incredible feat of engineering, the ISO range can now be extended to ISO 3280000 equivalent, at the Hi 5 setting. Designed for specialist use, such as surveillance or security applications, these astonishingly high ISO counts enable colour images to be captured without a flash in astronomical twilight, which is equivalent to an amazingly low 0.001 lux.


153-Point AF and 200 NEF (RAW) Image Buffer
With an incredible 153 focus points and 99 cross-type sensors, the D5 offers exceptionally wide coverage. Whether youâre shooting the race or the red carpet, almost every situation is covered. Small subjects moving at high speed can be tracked with a new level of precision. Subjects at the edge of the frame are easily detected, and vertical shooting is vastly improved. AF sensitivity down to -4 EV (ISO 100, 20 Â°C/68 Â°F) enables superior low-light performance and all AF modes have been improved. The system is configurable in 153-point, 72-point and 25-point coverage settings in Continuous AF mode. All 153 focus points are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses with an open aperture of f/5.6 or faster, and 15 central focus points work with an effective aperture of f/8. The cameraâs high-performance buffer allows up to 200 NEF (RAW) or large JPEG images to be captured during one high-speed burst: enough to cover an entire 100 m sprint final without taking your finger off the shutter-release button.


Power and Precision
Thanks to a new AF ASIC unit, maximum computing power is allocated to AF at all times. No matter how fast the action, the camera does not compromise. Shoot at up to 12 fps with AE/AF tracking, or at up to 14 fps with mirror up. AF tracking and viewfinder visibility are vastly improved when shooting sports, or any scene in which subjects tend to change direction suddenly. Faster sequential shutter and mirror mechanisms significantly reduce viewfinder blackout during high-speed bursts. For ultimate precision, pair the D5 with a professional NIKKOR lens equipped with SPORT VR mode, such as the AF-S NIKKOR 600mm f/4E or the AF-S NIKKOR 500mm f/4E. SPORT VR mode also delivers a stable viewfinder image when tracking high-speed movement. Combine the D5 with one of these lenses and youâll capture fast-moving, unpredictable subjects with unprecedented smoothness.


Image Sensor and Metering
The all-new 20.8 MP FX-format CMOS image sensor and 180K-pixel RGB metering sensor deliver phenomenally accurate subject recognition and image detail. Even if youâre shooting fast sports indoors, this camera will get you the shot. And not just any shot: tonal gradations are richer and more accurate. The D5 also boasts a new 8.0 cm (3.2 in.), 2360k-dot LCD monitor, which offers touch operation in review mode. With a level of responsiveness comparable to smartphones, this high-resolution screen means you can easily check and select key images on the spot. Shoot in Live View and you can use touch operation to change the focus point, or acquire preset Spot White Balance data, based on the selected area within the frame. For even greater control, Picture Control 2.0 makes it easy to define parameters whether youâre shooting stills or video. Ease post-production with the Flat pre-setting for maximum dynamic range; fine-adjust detail with Clarity.


4K High-Definition D-Movies
4K movies (3840x2160 pixels) can be recorded at 30p/25p/24p in dot-by-dot native pixel crop, which ensures the highest image quality. When shooting Full HD (1080p) video, you can record at frame rates up to 50p/60p in multiple sensor crop formats, including native Full HD pixel crop. When filming in M mode, sensitivity for all video resolutions and crop modes can be set from ISO 100 all the way up to Hi 5. Auto ISO allows ISO 200 up to Hi 5, and lets you configure the maximum ISO settings you want to work with. The camera offers clean HDMI out: even 4K movies can be recorded to the in-camera memory card or output uncompressed to HDMI with 8-bit 4:2:2 YCbCr. HDMI output is available for all movie resolutions during remote shooting.


High-speed image captur fast data transfer
This camera reduces the stress factors that come with the demands of professional photography. Ergonomically, improvements include buttons with more defined ridges and curves, which enable more intuitive control, especially when shooting through the viewfinder. New double XQD card slots easily handle the D5âs incredible capacity to shoot up to 200 NEF (RAW) images in one burst, and ensure the buffer is instantly cleared for the next burst. A new USB 3.0 port enables high-speed transfer of large amounts of data, and wireless and Ethernet connection is now 2x faster.

The Pentax K-1 is the flagship model of the acclaimed Pentax K series. Along with a weatherproof construction and 36.4 effective megapixels, this 35mm full-frame Digital SLR includes state-of-the-art high-resolution technologies drawn from Pentaxâs development of medium-format models, plus an array of exclusive shooting features.     




Full-frame CMOS image sensor
The K-1 incorporates a newly developed 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor, one that assures the highest image quality to be found in the K-mount SLR series. Thanks to its large imaging area and wide pixel pitch, this high-pixel sensor delivers lively, true-to-life images with rich gradation and minimal noise. Its shallow depth of field allows you to control the sense of depth and bokeh (defocused) effect at will.


36.4 effective megapixels
Thanks to its approximately 36.4 effective megapixels, the K-1 delivers breathtaking, true-to-life imagesâthe kind that will seize the viewerâs imagination. Its exceptional resolving power captures each leaf of a distant tree or every drop of a spray in the finest detail. Since it provides image data large enough to produce a brilliant A2-size print (at 300dpi), the photographer is assured of great flexibility in image composition, either by cropping the image during shooting, or trimming the captured image during processing. By processing large volumes of data with its 14-bit image-processing system, the K-1 delivers beautiful, rich-gradation images.


AA-filter-free design
An optical AA (anti-aliasing) filter will affect the cameraâs image resolving power, even though it will help reduce moirÃ© and false color. The K-1 incorporates an AA-filter-free design to optimize the image resolving power of its high-pixel image sensor.


Prime IV Engine
The K-1 features a newly designed PRIME IV imaging engine. Compared with the previous PRIME III version, it is fine-tuned to process higher-resolution images, while boosting the operating frequency by nearly 50 percent. Its noise-processing algorithm has also been upgraded to capture beautiful, fine-gradation images at higher sensitivities. A combination of an advanced scene analysis system and new image-processing functions helps improve the accuracy and reliability of image reproduction.


ISO 204800
By taking full advantage of the image sensor excelled in noise-resistance performance and the PRIME IV imaging engine, the K-1 provides a top sensitivity of ISO 204800 (at standard output sensitivity). This not only delivers high-resolution images free of tone jumps and graininess at high-sensitivity settings, but also improves image quality in the low-sensitivity range. Since the K-1 allows you to raise the sensitivity level to capture images equal in image quality to those taken at lower sensitivities, it expands the boundaries of photographic expression.


Newly developed AF system, with an expanded AF detection area
The K-1âs AF frame has been widened to optimize the ease of image composition over a larger 35mm full-frame image field. Thanks to the development of a new SAFOX 12 AF sensor module, its autofocus area is approximately 40 percent wider than a conventional AF frame.* In order to contain a longer optical path required for the expanded AF area within a compact housing, the K-1 features an innovative, efficient optical design in which the incoming light is turned back within the AF module. Thanks to the optimization of the condenser lens, it also provides an increased number of AF sensor points (33 in total). This state-of-the-art AF module boosts both compact dimensions and exceptional image-forming performance.


33-point AF system with 25 cross-shaped sensors
The K-1âs sophisticated 33-point AF system has a high-density distribution of AF sensors to effectively monitor crucial areas of the image field, while providing 25 cross-shaped sensors to assure extra-accurate focus on the subject.


1/8000-second high-speed shutter
The K-1 features an electronically controlled, vertical-run shutter to optimize the performance of the 35mm full-frame image sensor. With a top speed of 1/8000 second, it allows you to open up the aperture, even in bright locations, and take full advantage of the bokeh (defocus) effect created by the large image sensor. It also provides a flash synchronization speed of 1/200 second. Symbolizing the K-1âs field camera concept, this unit is designed to be compact and lightweight, with a well-balanced combination of high-precision operation and outstanding durability.


High-speed drive mode
The K-1 provides high-speed continuous shooting at a top speed of approximately 4.4 images per second (at CH setting). You can also switch instantly to an optional speed setting of three images per second (CM) or 0.7 images per second (CL) using the main menu or Smart Function. In the APS-C Crop mode, the drive speed can be boosted to as high as approximately 6.5 images per second to assure quick response to fast-moving subjects.


Pixel Shift Resolution System
Reinforced with the SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism, the K-1âs Pixel Shift Resolution System captures four images of the same scene by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for each image, then synthesizes them into a single, super-high-resolution composite image. Compared to the conventional Bayer system, this innovative system obtains all RGB colour data in each pixel to deliver beautiful images with far more truthful colours and much finer details, without any hint of false colour. This system also reduces high-sensitivity noise to a minimum. The difference in image quality is evident at a glance, even without magnifying the captured image on a computer screen or producing a large-size print. Images captured by the Pixel Shift Resolution System can be saved as RAW-format files. You can developed these files within the camera body while adjusting various parameters or turning the Pixel Shift Resolution effect on and off to create a new image.


Motion Correction function
When shooting an image with the Pixel Shift Resolution System, the K-1 provides a new Motion Correction function. When this function is activated, the camera automatically detects the amount of subject motion during continuous shooting and minimizes negative effects during the synthesizing process.


AA filter simulator
By using the cameraâs SR mechanism to apply microscopic vibrations to the image sensor, the PENTAX-original AA (anti-aliasing) filter simulator effectively minimizes moirÃ© and false color along the imageâs edges, which are common problems when shooting subjects with minute patterns. The K-1 allows you to faithfully reproduce your creative intention on a captured image, either by simulating the AA-filter effect for well-balanced images or by opting for the AA-filter-free mode for greater resolving power.


Diffraction Correction
This function compensates for the drop in resolving power caused by the diffraction during image processing. Based on obtained image data, it provides an exposure compensation of up to approximately two aperture steps, making it useful for such subjects as landscapes, which requires you to close down the aperture to widen a depth of field without compromising the resolving power.


Fine Sharpness and Extra Sharpness
No matter how many pixels and how much resolving power an image sensor may provide, the captured image can appear as a low-resolution image if the subject is outlined with thick lines. The K-1âs Fine Sharpness function outlines the subject with thinner, more natural lines than those created by normal processing to produce a high-quality, fine-detailed image. It allows you to create a fine piece of art, with a true-to-life description of the subject. The K-1 also provides an Extra Sharpness function, which emphasizes the subjectâs outline more prominently with much finer lines, making it particularly useful for enhancing the outline of a low-contrast subject.


In-body shake reduction mechanism
The PENTAX-original sensor-shift-type shake reduction mechanism has been upgraded to provide optimum compensation for all lenses used in handheld shooting. The new-generation SR II (Shake Reduction II) features a five-axis mechanism to compensate for camera shake caused by horizontal and vertical shift. The SR II unit is controlled with great precision as soon as the cameraâs power is turned on, and provides a wide compensation range â as much as five shutter steps.


Dustproof, weather-resistant construction
A combination of the K-1âs 87 sealing parts and the optional D-BG6 Battery Gripâs watertight body prevents the intrusion of water and dust into their interior. When an AW- or WR-series lens is mounted, the K-1 and its lens forms a remarkable digital imaging system totally resistant to demanding environmental factors. The camera is also -10Â°C cold-resistant. 


Flexible Tilt-Type LCD monitor
PENTAX has designed an ideal LCD monitor for the K-1 by creating an innovative mechanism that supports the monitor with four stays. This monitor has reached two difficult goals that conventional monitors have failed to attain: no deviation from the optical axis; and unrestricted tilt in all directions, horizontally or vertically. You can even tilt it up to a nearly 90-degree angle for low-angle and waist-level photography.


Outdoor-oriented LCD monitor
With a single push of a button, the K-1âs new Outdoor View Setting mode displays five brightness settings on its LCD monitor, allowing you to easily and quickly set the desired brightness level for a given location â brightening the monitor under dazzling sunshine or darkening it under starlit skies.


Optical viewfinder with a nearly 100% field of view
The K-1âs optical viewfinder provides a nearly 100-percent field of view and a 0.7-times magnification to deliver a sharp, crisp view of the subject and a large, well-defined image field, both of which are the benefits of the 35mm full-frame SLR camera. This viewfinder also provides a clear view of the image field free of aberrations, even at the edges. Its Natural-Bright-Matte III focusing screen makes it easy to identify the in-focus point, even during manual-focus operation.


Built-in GPS module and Electronic Compass
The K-1 features a built-in GPS module and Electronic Compass, which together display the camera's direction on the LCD monitor. These features allow you to attach Exif data to recorded images, including the location, direction and time of shooting (using Universal Time Coordinated). 


Movie recording
The K-1 records lively, true-to-life movies. Thanks to a shallow depth of field provided by its 35mm full-frame design, it effectively produces a beautiful bokeh effect.


4K-compatible Interval Movie shooting
The K-1âs Interval Movie mode allows you to record still images of a slowly changing subject at a fixed interval, and link them into a single movie file. You can play back the 4K-resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) movie file, as if fast-forwarding the time on the screen. The K-1 also provides the Star Stream function, which lets you draw the magical traces of stars in a movie.


Wi-Fi compatibility
By wirelessly connecting the K-1 with your smartphone, you can capture images from a distance, or browse them on the smartphone screen. You can set various shooting functions and change their settings, adjust the focus, release the shutter, and check the captured images.


In-body RAW data development
The K-1 provides in-body development of RAW-format files, with the developed files saved as separate JPEG or TIFF files. This offers greater flexibility in finishing a captured image more faithfully to your creative intention, without the help of a PC. Thanks to a wide range of adjustable parameters, you can add a desired finishing touch to your image regardless of a location, until you are truly satisfied with the result. The K-1 also features a newly designed user interface for more effortless, more flexible parameter control.


Dual card slot
The K-1âs card slot accepts two SD memory cards, with a choice of three data filing modes: âSerialâ to store a large volume of data successively from one card to another; âDuplicateâ (simultaneous filing) for simplified data backup, and âRAW/JPEG Divisionâ to separate data files based on the recording format. It is also possible to copy an image stored on one card to another.

The LUMIX GH5 is capable of even more faithful colour reproduction, with internal recording of video in 4:2:2 10-bit. With the 20.3-megapixel Digital LiveMOS Sensor and Venus Engine handling digital signals at ultra-high speed, image quality per frame is dramatically improved. The colour around edges is less jaggy, as well as being smoother, with rich colour reproduction and grading. For non-linear editing and for post-production colour grading, colour control is also much improved.


Features with Professional-style Expression
The Variable Frame Rate (VFR) lets you record overcranked and undercranked video, all in 4K (maximum 2.5x slower) or Full-HD (maximum 7.5x slower). In addition, the LUMIX GH5 complies with V-LogL video recording with the purchase of the optional Upgrade Software Key DMW-SFU1. Log recording offers exceptional flexibility with a wider dynamic range for colour grading, V-LogL featuring log characteristics with 12 steps. Now, with the Look Up Table (LUT) in camera, you can playback graded video footage recorded in V-LogL. Furthermore, as well as the conventional CINELIKE D and CINELIKE V presets, a new âLIKE 709â gamma - with characteristics similar to the standard used for HDTV - has been added. As such, you can shoot with rich image expression.


HDMI Output
The LUMIX GH5 can output video in 4:2:2 10-bit for every recording mode when not recording in-camera. Even while recording video to the main body, it can simultaneously output video in 4:2:2 10-bit, in virtually any recording mode. It uses the highly versatile Type-A HDMI terminal which, thanks to a cable lock holder, is far less prone to accidental disconnecting. You can choose to output the data with the menu or OSD information when you output video to the external video monitor and without them to the external recorder.


6K PHOTO
The new 6K PHOTO feature makes it possible to capture those special fleeting moments by extracting and singling out the most perfect frame from a 6K burst file at 30 fps (in either 4:3 or 3:2 aspect), saved as an approx. 18MP high resolution photo.


0.76x 3,680k-dot OLED LVF/3.2"" Free-angle Touch Monitor
The LUMIX GH5 boasts a Live View Finder (LVF) with an astounding high magnification ratio of approx. 1.52x / 0.76x (35mm camera equiv.). This uses a high-precision, high-speed and high-resolution 3,860K-dot OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) display with 100% field of view ratio. Thanks to this high-response OLED, the LVF achieves excellent visibility with an almost imperceptible time lag and a high 10,000:1 contrast. High visibility with comfort is also enjoyed by users wearing glasses due to an eye point distance of approx. 21 mm. The 3.2-inch free-angle rear monitor in 3:2 aspect with 1,620K-dot high resolution achieves an almost 100% field of view and uses a static-type touch control system. The monitor adopts White pixels in addition to RGB (Red, Green and Blue) pixels to deliver much improved visibility, even under direct sunlight. It also tilts approx. 270-degrees up and down for easier high or low angle shooting.


Double SD Card Slot
The LUMIX GH5 features the first UHS-II compatible double SD card slot in the LUMIX G series. In âRelay Recordingâ, recording onto the second card automatically starts when the first card reaches capacity. In âBackup Recordingâ, the same contents are recorded on both cards simultaneously. Furthermore, with âAllocation Recordingâ, it is possible to select either cards in Slot 1 or Slot 2 for RAW, JPEG, 4K PHOTO, or 4K video data.

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

BIONZ Xâ¢ for superior detail and texture
The high-speed BIONZ X image processing engine from Sony is as important as the lens and image sensor, as it powers conversion of light captured by the sensor, so photos and movies can be recorded with more natural details, more realism, richer tonal gradations and lower noise.


Remote control via smartphones and tablets
Thanks to built-in Wi-Fi, up to five RX0 cameras can be remotely controlled from a smartphone or tablet. Simply download free PlayMemories Mobile app to your mobile device for remote control of camera shutter release, movie recording start/stop, and instant receiving of captured footage. Also, Bluetooth is available and allows remote power on/off operation.


Up to 960fps/1000fps super slow motion
Super slow motion at frame rate of up to 960/1000fps is available to capture split-seconds of action in movies. Slow motion shooting at 480/500fps and 240/250fps especially maintains fine images at nearly HD quality with the choice of Quality Priority mode. End trigger mode lets you capture the decisive moment in super slow motion starting from two or four seconds before the REC button is pressed.


Handy features, compact form
The smooth extra super duralumin body is designed without protruding parts for distinctive quality, strength and sophistication. Although this high-rigidity camera is sufficiently compact to fit in a palm, it integrates such convenient features as LCD monitor and buttons with ease of use, durability and performance that you can rely on even under harsh shooting conditions.


Clean HDMI output for 4K movies
For production flexibility, you can use Clean HDMI output to record uncompressed video to an external recorder in your choice of formats and bitrates, including non-compressed 4K movie, and monitor the footage. Moreover, stunning high-precision 4K images with suppressed moirÃ© and jaggies can be delivered via data readout without pixel binning or line skipping.


Up to 16fps continuous shooting with reduced blackout
Despite its 15.3MP high pixel count, the super-high-speed image sensor boosts readout speed to the extent that the camera can achieve continuous shooting up to 16fps.


Wide ISO sensitivity
Sensitivity extends up to ISO 12800, for crisper images in extremely low light. Let Auto ISO mode determine the most appropriate setting automatically, or manually expand sensitivity as low as ISO 80. The camera also allows you to set up lower limit shutter speed at time of Auto ISO setting.


Choose pro-quality XAVC S or AVCHD movie recording
Low-compression XAVC S format is excellent, especially among serious videographers, for expression of high-quality movies with minimal noise, even in scenes full of movement. The camera also features AVCHD format for easy editing and sharing.


Up to 1/32000 sec. Anti-Distortion Shutter
Thanks to the Exmor RS sensorâs extremely fast readout, the Anti-Distortion Shutter that is capable of shutter speeds up to 1/32000 sec. minimises image distortion caused by the rolling shutter phenomenon that can otherwise distort shots of swiftly moving subjects.

Nikon have also made huge improvements in autofocusing. A multi-Cam 20k focusing processor allows the camera to do advanced calculations to track subjects across the frame using the 153-autofocusing points that cover large areas.

As well as the optical viewfinder for composing images thereâs also a 3.2-inch touchscreen with a 2,359,000 dot resolution.





Incredible low-light performamnce
The Nikon D5 blows the possibilities for low-light shooting wide open. With a standard ISO range of 100 to 102400, and the highest expanded sensitivity in Nikonâs history. Thanks to the cameraâs new EXPEED 5 image processing engine, image quality is unprecedentedly high across the standard ISO range. This exceptionally clean performance is made possible by a signal processing system optimised for the new sensor's 25% higher pixel count. Fine noise is dramatically reduced and even cropped images shot at high ISOs retain their quality. In an incredible feat of engineering, the ISO range can now be extended to ISO 3280000 equivalent, at the Hi 5 setting. Designed for specialist use, such as surveillance or security applications, these astonishingly high ISO counts enable colour images to be captured without a flash in astronomical twilight, which is equivalent to an amazingly low 0.001 lux.


153-Point AF and 200 NEF (RAW) Image Buffer
With an incredible 153 focus points and 99 cross-type sensors, the D5 offers exceptionally wide coverage. Whether youâre shooting the race or the red carpet, almost every situation is covered. Small subjects moving at high speed can be tracked with a new level of precision. Subjects at the edge of the frame are easily detected, and vertical shooting is vastly improved. AF sensitivity down to -4 EV (ISO 100, 20 Â°C/68 Â°F) enables superior low-light performance and all AF modes have been improved. The system is configurable in 153-point, 72-point and 25-point coverage settings in Continuous AF mode. All 153 focus points are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses with an open aperture of f/5.6 or faster, and 15 central focus points work with an effective aperture of f/8. The cameraâs high-performance buffer allows up to 200 NEF (RAW) or large JPEG images to be captured during one high-speed burst: enough to cover an entire 100 m sprint final without taking your finger off the shutter-release button.


Power and Precision
Thanks to a new AF ASIC unit, maximum computing power is allocated to AF at all times. No matter how fast the action, the camera does not compromise. Shoot at up to 12 fps with AE/AF tracking, or at up to 14 fps with mirror up. AF tracking and viewfinder visibility are vastly improved when shooting sports, or any scene in which subjects tend to change direction suddenly. Faster sequential shutter and mirror mechanisms significantly reduce viewfinder blackout during high-speed bursts. For ultimate precision, pair the D5 with a professional NIKKOR lens equipped with SPORT VR mode, such as the AF-S NIKKOR 600mm f/4E or the AF-S NIKKOR 500mm f/4E. SPORT VR mode also delivers a stable viewfinder image when tracking high-speed movement. Combine the D5 with one of these lenses and youâll capture fast-moving, unpredictable subjects with unprecedented smoothness.


Image Sensor and Metering
The all-new 20.8 MP FX-format CMOS image sensor and 180K-pixel RGB metering sensor deliver phenomenally accurate subject recognition and image detail. Even if youâre shooting fast sports indoors, this camera will get you the shot. And not just any shot: tonal gradations are richer and more accurate. The D5 also boasts a new 8.0 cm (3.2 in.), 2360k-dot LCD monitor, which offers touch operation in review mode. With a level of responsiveness comparable to smartphones, this high-resolution screen means you can easily check and select key images on the spot. Shoot in Live View and you can use touch operation to change the focus point, or acquire preset Spot White Balance data, based on the selected area within the frame. For even greater control, Picture Control 2.0 makes it easy to define parameters whether youâre shooting stills or video. Ease post-production with the Flat pre-setting for maximum dynamic range; fine-adjust detail with Clarity.


4K High-Definition D-Movies
4K movies (3840x2160 pixels) can be recorded at 30p/25p/24p in dot-by-dot native pixel crop, which ensures the highest image quality. When shooting Full HD (1080p) video, you can record at frame rates up to 50p/60p in multiple sensor crop formats, including native Full HD pixel crop. When filming in M mode, sensitivity for all video resolutions and crop modes can be set from ISO 100 all the way up to Hi 5. Auto ISO allows ISO 200 up to Hi 5, and lets you configure the maximum ISO settings you want to work with. The camera offers clean HDMI out: even 4K movies can be recorded to the in-camera memory card or output uncompressed to HDMI with 8-bit 4:2:2 YCbCr. HDMI output is available for all movie resolutions during remote shooting.


High-speed image captur fast data transfer
This camera reduces the stress factors that come with the demands of professional photography. Ergonomically, improvements include buttons with more defined ridges and curves, which enable more intuitive control, especially when shooting through the viewfinder. New double XQD card slots easily handle the D5âs incredible capacity to shoot up to 200 NEF (RAW) images in one burst, and ensure the buffer is instantly cleared for the next burst. A new USB 3.0 port enables high-speed transfer of large amounts of data, and wireless and Ethernet connection is now 2x faster.

The Sony 24-70mm F2.8 ZA SSM II Lens employs two aspherical elements and two ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements in a precision optical design for excellent resolution and contrast. The basic optical design is the same as the original version, which is widely regarded as being more like a prime lens than a zoom in terms of image quality.


Focus mode switch and hold button
In addition to generally convenient positioning and smooth operation of all controls, this lens includes a focus mode switch and focus hold button on the barrel for extra focusing versatility and control.


Smooth, quiet SSM focusing
The SSM (Super Sonic wave Motor) is a piezoelectric drive system that works with an internal focus mechanism in the Vario-Sonnar T* 24-70mm F2.8 ZA SSM II for smooth, silent autofocus with no front element rotation. Its capacity for high torque at low rotational speeds contributes to fast start and stop response as well as precise positioning.


Great results in low light
A bright constant F2.8 maximum aperture throughout the zoom range means consistent exposure settings at any focal length as well as improved low-light capability. Thereâs no worry about aperture related exposure variations as you zoom, and you can get great results shooting hand held indoors or in other dimly lit situations.


Close-up capability
The Vario-Sonnar T* 24-70mm F2.8 ZA SSM II can focus as close as 34 centimeters for a 0.25 magnification ratio that makes it possible to capture small subjects and details with excellent quality.


Beautiful background bokeh
A 9-blade circular aperture works with this lensâs F2.8 maximum aperture to produce beautifully smooth background bokeh with natural highlights when desired. Smooth background defocusing can make the in-focus focus really stand out in images with almost three-dimensional depth.


Aspherical elements
Aspherical lens elements are more difficult to manufacture than simple spherical types, but when properly designed they can reduce a wide range of optical aberrations to extremely low levels. This lens includes two aspherical elements that contribute to stellar overall optical performance.


ED glass suppresses chromatic aberration
This lens includes two ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements that greatly reduce chromatic aberration, particularly at longer focal lengths. They also contribute to superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings.


Reduced ghosting improves image quality
ZEISS T* coating achieves even greater reduction of ghosting, taking image quality that is already highly regarded to a new level.


Dust and moisture resistant
Some of the most exciting images are captured in challenging environments. A dust and moisture resistant design means that the lens will continue to perform reliably in moderately wet or dusty conditions, so you can shoot with confidence wherever those great shots are found.

For the main processing engine, âSnapdragonâ of Qualcomm, which is well known for mobile SoC, is newly adopted. Not only for its advanced video data processing, it contributes to many other performances improvement such as increased processing speed of still image, high speed wireless data transfer, feature expansion, and power saving.


Image quailty
By renewing  image sensor, image processing engine and image processing technology, image quality is further improved additional to 2K to 4K upgrade. Gives further reality with VR experience.


Shutter speed, ISO Sensitivity
With the highest shutter speed of 1/25000sec (THETA S:1/6400 sec), shooting situation is widened.
With AUTO mode, ISO is 1600  which is as same as THETA S but with Manual Mode, ISO can be set to 3200.  With this spec change, THETA V is good in to capturing dark scenes.


State-of-the-Art Image Processing Technology
AE accuracy is improved. With this improvement, over exposer and under exposer is reduced during high contrast scenes, or even at dark inside situation, THETA V is shot with appropriate exposure. With the improvement of image processing ability, shooting interval is shorten to 4 sec  from 8 sec. This will widen the range of usage for time laps movie creation.


High speed data transfer
With the wireless communication module improvement, communication speed is drastically increased. As the imaging process speed is also improved, transfer speed of both still and video became extremely fast.


4K Live Streaming
360Â° live streaming is upgraded to 4K (3840Ã1920, 30fps). High quality UVC output via USB to PC is possible.


4ch microphone 360Â° spatial audio
Conventionally audio was recorded in monaural, so the VR experience which we can offered was image only.
With THETA V, as it can record 360Â° spatial audio, the sound and the image is linked as a spherical video for further immersive VR experience.

The stylish Fujifilm X-E3 is an ultra-compact, mirrorless camera featuring Fujifilm's 24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III APS-C sensor which boasts outstanding image quality and enhanced handling. Utilising the X-Processor Pro gives superb reproduction in both stills and 4K movies. The X-E3 is the first X Series model to feature Bluetooth low energy wireless communication. Users can pair the camera with their smartphone or tablet device for easy transfer of pictures taken using minimal power â perfect for sharing images with friends and online.


The X-E3 features a static touchscreen panel which supports the conventional Touch Shot, Touch AF and Focus Area Selection capabilities. An all-new Touch Function , which enables gesture controls reminiscent of smartphones, like flick and pinch zoom, to further enhance touchscreen operation. In addition, the AF algorithm has been updated to enhance the cameraâs performance for tracking a moving subject. 


Compact and lightweight body
Fuji have re-designed the camera body of the popular X-E2 to create the most compact and lightweight model within the X Series interchangeable lens camera range, with a viewfinder. The well-balanced proportions and the grip-shaped design make the camera incredibly comfortable to hold. The new model also supports the Focus Lever, a popular feature first introduced in the  X-Pro2, allowing you to instantaneously change the focus area whilst keeping an eye on the viewfinder.


Outstanding image quality, high-speed response and upgraded AF tracking performance
The X-E3 features a 24.3 megapixel APS-C sized X-TransTM CMOS III sensor and X-Processor Pro image processing engine for outstanding image quality and high-speed response. The X-E3 features a large phase detection AF area and an updated algorithm to deliver a fastest AF speed of 0.06sec. The X-E3 also offers 5.0fps live-view shooting, a quick start-up time of 0.4sec., a shutter time lag of 0.050sec. and a shooting interval of 0.25sec. Thanks to the newly developed image recognition algorithm, the X-E3 is able to track moving subjects twice as fast as previous models.


Enhanced connectivity with BluetoothÂ® wireless communication
This is the first X Series camera to offer Bluetooth capability. Pair it with your smartphone or tablet device, in advance of shooting, to easily transfer pictures you have taken to the smartphone or tablet device via the smart-device app, Fujifilm Camera Remote.


Upgraded intuitive touchscreen operation
The LCD monitor uses a high-resolution 1.04M dot, 3.0-inch static touchscreen panel display. Turning the Touch Panel Settings on allows the following operations during shooting and playback modes:
Shooting Modes:

Focus Area Selection: Move the focus point to the chosen position by tapping the LCD monitor.
Touch Shot: Touch to focus on a specific point, then take the picture.



Playback Modes:

Swipe Movement : Swiping a finger across the screen scrolls through the images, one after the other.
Double-Tap Enlargement: Tapping the screen twice will enlarge the image, centering on the active focus point when the image was taken.
Drag: Moving a finger across the screen when an image is enlarged will move it around the frame.
Pinch out: Placing two fingers on the screen and widening the distance between them enlarges the image.
Pinch in: While the image being displayed is enlarged, placing two fingers on the screen and narrowing the distance between them reduces the image size and displays the last 9 images.
All the touchscreen functions are disabled when the âTouch Panel Settingsâ are turned off.


The camera also features the âTouch Functionâ, in which you can use flick motions in up â down and right â left directions to call pre-assigned functions. Use the drag motion on the touchscreen panel, even while keeping your eye on the EVF, to change the focus area location. 


High resolution and high definition 4K video recording
The X-E3 is capable of recording both Full HD and 4K video using the X Seriesâ reputable Film Simulation modes. You can output recorded video to an external monitor, via the HDMI port, and input audio from an external microphone.

The Nikon Df Digital SLR is a full-frame retro-styled camera that's packed with the latest technologies. It boasts the same 16.2 megapixel FX-format sensor as the Nikon's flagship D4, and thanks to a wide dynamic range & light sensitivity that is extendable up to an incredible ISO 204,800 (equivalent), detailed photographs with smooth tonal gradations are achievable in any light. Built to withstand severe conditions, the Df boasts tough yet lightweight magnesium alloy top, bottom, and rear covers, and is weather-sealed to the same degree as the Nikon D800 for enhanced resistance to moisture and dust.

Nikon Retro design
Boasting looks inspired by classic 35mm Nikon film cameras and technology from Nikonâs latest professional DSLRs, the Df is dedicated to pure photography. The Df is portable too thanks to a compact body that weighs approximately 710g. It features a tough yet lightweight magnesium alloy top, bottom, and rear covers, and is weather-sealed.

16.2-megapixel FX-format (full-frame) CMOS sensor
Equipped with the same image sensor as Nikonâs flagship D4, the Df offers exquisitely detailed images with smooth tonal gradations.

High-speed performance
Boasts approximately 0.14 s start-up time and 0.052 s shutter-release time lag. High-speed continuous shooting is available at up to 5.5 fps in both FX and DX formats.

Low-light/strong light

With ISO 100â12,800, extendable up to 204,800 (equivalent), the Df delivers finely detailed images with minimal noise, even when you shoot under challenging lighting conditions. In high-contrast conditions, two modes help capture the details in strong light, or in backlit situations. HDR (High Dynamic Range) is ideal for stationary subjects and Active D-Lighting is ideal for photos of moving subjects. Both modes allow you to select the intensity level.

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

Combined with an AA-filter-free optical design, this image sensor delivers super-high-resolution images. Also, by coupling a newly developed accelerator unit with the high-speed PRIME MII imaging engine, the PENTAX K-70 effectively minimizes noise at all sensitivity levels, and captures rich-gradation, fine-detailed images even in super-high-sensitivity shooting at a top sensitivity of ISO 102400.


Hybrid AF system for high-speed AF operation during Live View shooting
The PENTAX K-70 employs PENTAXâs first Hybrid AF system during Live View autofocus operation. By positioning a contrast-detection AF sensor with superior focusing accuracy and a phase-matching AF sensor on the image sensorâs surface, this innovative hybrid system optimizes the benefits of both AF systems to deliver high-speed, pinpoint AF focusing on the subject.


Dustproof, weather-resistant body perfect for rugged outdoor photography
The PENTAX K-70 is a dependable performer even in demanding  situations, such as in the rain or at locations prone to dust or freezing temperatures, It combines a compact, easy-to-carry body in a dustproof, weather-resistant construction delivering outstanding cold-proof performance at temperatures down to -10Â°C. It has also been designed for active outdoor shooting â such as mountain climbing, camping and a range of sporting situations. The improved handling of the camera was achieved by the design of a new grip, and a complete design review of the mode dial and control buttons. In addition to its outdoor-friendly LCD monitor, on which the brightness of the screen can be adjusted according to the light levels of the shooting location, it also features a red-lit monitor display function, which works to the photographerâs eye when it has become accustomed to a low-light location, such as during astronomical photography.


High-precision autofocus system with the SAFOX X module
The PENTAX K-70 features the high-precision SAFOX X AF sensor module, for a responsive, dependable autofocus operation. With its 11 sensors, including nine cross-type sensors in the middle, this AF module delivers pinpoint focus on the subject at a minimum brightness level as low as -3 EV. By revising the timing of the AF sensorâs start-up action, the speed of autofocus response has been improved, especially at low-light levels. The focusing accuracy in the AF-C mode has also been enhanced by improving the algorithm for moving objects. The PENTAX K-70 delivers outstanding AF tracking performance for subjects on the move, thanks to advanced features including the Select-area Expansion function, which automatically refocuses on a moving subject after it moves away from the initial point, with the help of the neighbouring points; and an AF Hold function that maintains the initial in-focus point even when the module loses sight of the subject.


Shake-reduction system
Thanks to the built-in PENTAX-original SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism, the PENTAX K-70 effectively minimizes camera shake and delivers sharp, blur-free images, even in camera-shake-prone conditions such as using a telephoto lens, shooting in low-light , or photographing sunset scenes. Using a high-accuracy gyro sensor, it provides a compensation effect of 4.5 shutter steps, a level close to that of premium models. When taking a panning shot, this mechanism automatically detects the direction of the cameraâs movement, and efficiently controls the SR unit to produce the best image possible without requiring any mode switching operation.


Pixel Shift Resolution System with motion correction function
The PENTAX K-70 features the latest super-resolution technology called Pixel Shift Resolution System,* which captures four images of the same scene by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for each image, and then synthesizing them into a single composite image. Compared to the conventional Bayer system, in which each pixel has only a single colour data unit, this innovative system obtains all colour data in each pixel to deliver super-high-resolution images with far more truthful colours and much finer details than those produced by conventional APS-C-size image sensors. This system also provides a motion correction function,** which automatically detects a moving object during continuous shooting and minimizes negative effects during the synthesizing process, in order to accommodate a wider range of scenes and subjects.


Innovative AA filter simulator 
By applying microscopic vibrations to the image sensor unit at the sub-pixel level during image exposure, the PENTAX K-70's AA (anti-aliasing) filter simulator provides the same level of moirÃ© reduction as an optical AA filter. Unlike an optical AA filter, which always creates the identical result, this innovative simulator lets the user switch the AA filter effect on and off to adjust the level of the effect. This means that the ideal effect can be set for a particular scene or subject based on the photographic conditions.


Optical viewfinder with nearly 100-percent field of view
Within its compact body, the PENTAX K-70 incorporates a glass prism finder featuring the same optics and coatings as those used in premium models. With a nearly 100-percent field of view and a magnification of approximately 0.95 times, it provides a wide, bright image field for easy focusing and framing.


High-speed shutter 
With a top shutter speed of 1/6000 second, the PENTAX K-70 captures sharply focused images, even with fast-moving subjects. Coupled with its high-speed continuous shooting function with a top speed of approximately six images per second, it lets the photographer preserve once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunities in beautifully focused images.


Upgraded Full HD movie recording
The PENTAX K-70 captures high-resolution, flawless Full HD movie clips (1920 x 1080 pixels; 60i/30p frame rate) in the H.264 recording format, and records lively stereo sound using a built-in stereo microphone. In combination with compatible lenses, it allows users  to operate the Continuous AF (AF-C) mode* to keep accurate focus on a moving subject, or take advantage of a new aperture control function** to automatically deliver a proper exposure level even in fluctuating lighting conditions during movie recording. It also provides a host of distinctive visual effects for movie production, including the 4K Interval Movie mode that connects a series of 4K-resolution still images at a fixed interval to create a single movie file, and a Star Stream mode to fade in and out the traces of stars to recorded movies.


Vari-angle LCD monitor 
The PENTAX K-70âs vari-angle LCD monitor allows for the positioning of the monitor at any desired angle, making it easier to compose the image in a wide variety of applications, such as high-angle shooting done at armâs length, or low-angle shots taken from ground level. It also features a unique air-gapless construction, in which the air space between LCD layers is eliminated to effectively reduce the reflection and dispersion of light for improved visibility during outdoor shooting.


Wi-Fi connection to support smartphone operation

The Canon EOS 5D Mark IV is the eagerly anticipated successor to Canon's best selling EOS 5D Mark III. The 5D MKIV offers several significant improvements including a new 30.4MP CMOS full-frame sensor, an upgraded AF system, 4K video recording plus 4K Frame Grab, ISO 100-32000 which is expandable to 102400, 7 fps continuous shooting, Wi-Fi with NFC plus GPS, improved weather-sealing and much more.





30.4 Megapixel Full-frame CMOS Sensor
Shoot captivating stills wherever you are, day or night. 30.4-megapixel resolution delivers extraordinary detail.


Improved focusing
With 61 points the 5D Mark IV has the same number of autofocus (AF) points as the 5D Mark III, but the AF system has been given a refresh and made similar to the one in the flagship Canon EOS 1DX Mark II. Of the 61 points, 41 are the more sensitive cross-type, with 21 of those being cross-type with maximum apertures as small as f/8. There are also 5 points that are dual cross-type at f/8. Having more cross-type points makes the 5D Mark IV better than the Mark III at detecting subjects, and making the system sensitive down to f/8 means it works better when teleconverters are used to extend the reach of telephoto lenses. Anti-flicker technology combats variations in brightness under artificial lighting.


Engineered to perform
In pursuit of the perfect moment, the EOS 5D MARK IV can shoot continuously at 7fps. Its viewfinder and user interface are highly customisable, with intuitive touch-screen operation offering new levels of camera control. Add weather-proof sealing and you have a DSLR thatâs at home in just about any environment you can think of.


Cinematic 4K video
Record your movie moments using the power of EOS 5D Mark IVâs incredible sensor to add detail and extra refinement to every scene. With options to record in high-resolution 4K1 as well as Full HD for frame rate options including 60p slow motion, the world of DSLR film making just got better.


A feature taken from the EOS-1D X Mark II, EOS 5D Mark IV users can shoot 4K movies and save any frame as a beautifully detailed 8.8-megapixel still image straight to memory card as a JPEG file.


Exceptional low light capture
Low light performance is improved at every ISO setting, with much reduced digital noise and a maximum sensitivity of ISO 32,000 (expandable to ISO 102,400). Be confident of superb image quality even when shooting in poor light.


Stay connected
Thereâs other data in the EOS 5D MARK IVâs files too. Built-in GPS tags images with your location as you shoot them. IPTC metadata can also be embedded. With in-camera RAW processing itâs easy to produce client-ready JPEGs, and Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity makes it simple to send or share them, using either  FTP/FTPS networking facilities or your smartphone.

The tough and lightweight Nikon D5600 is equipped with a large 24.2 megapixel DX-format image sensor, capable of sharply capturing fine textures and rendering images with superbly crisp detail. An ISO range of 100-25600, and an expanded ISO sensitivity of 6400 in Night Landscape mode, ensures low-light scenes and difficult lighting situations are handled with ease. The EXPEED 4 image-processing engine boasts superior noise-reduction performance even at high ISOs. Share your images and videos using Nikon easy-to-use Snapbridge connectivity.


Faultless ergonomics
Create eye-catching compositions thanks to the high-quality optical viewfinder, which delivers an incredibly clear view through the lensâwhen you want to focus on your subject, shooting through the viewfinder lets you block out sunlight and distractions. You can also maintain a more stable hold on the camera when using a telephoto lens. The well-placed command dial and multi-selector make it easy to change settings as you shoot. And you can even use the touch Fn function to adjust settings via the large touchscreen without taking your eye away from the viewfinder. With a body that weighs just 415g (approx), and a monocoque carbon-reinforced shell, this camera is lightweight and tough enough to take anywhere. 


Vari-angle touchscreen
Now you can shoot with a DSLR that sees the world like you doâeven when you see it from a completely different angle. Simply flip, tilt, or rotate the large 3.2-inch vari-angle touchscreen to compose perfect shots: youâll get a clear view whether the camera is up high, down low, or extended away from your body. You tap the touchscreen to focus and shoot, just like a smartphone. And you can use touch controls during viewfinder shooting or image playback. During viewfinder shooting, the touch Fn function offers an intuitive alternative to using the command dial or multi-selector: now you can select the focus point or adjust other important settings, like Aperture, Auto Sensitivity and more, via the large touchscreen. During image playback, a frame advance bar inherited from Nikonâs professional D5 and D500 cameras lets you quickly scroll through images. And you can pinch to zoom in and quickly trim an image.


Speed and precision
Whether youâre in the midst of the action or shooting from a distance, the D5600âs razor-sharp AF system will lock onto your subject and keep it in focus. The AF systemâs 39 focus points cover a wide area of the frame, and nine highly accurate cross-type sensors in the central area deliver enhanced accuracy. When you shoot in Live View, the cameraâs contrast-detect AF keeps you right on target. And when that perfect opportunist shot appears out of nowhere, this camera can shoot at a swift five frames per second to nail the moment with perfect precision.


Full HD Movies
Record smooth, finely detailed Full HD video clips youâll be proud to share. D-Movie enables recording at frame rates of up to 50p/60p. Continuous Live View autofocus (Full-time-servo AF mode)  keeps your subjects sharp even when the action is fast. And if you shoot with an AF-P NIKKOR kit lens, footage will be practically free of drive noise thanks to the lensâ built-in stepping motor. Time-Lapse Movie, inherited from Nikonâs advanced DSLRs, transforms scenes of slow-moving clouds, or a crowded street, into dramatic high-speed sequences. And movies shot with the D5600 are easy to share via the cameraâs SnapBridge connection.


In-camera Creative Tools
Maximize the impact of your photos and movies with a range of in-camera creative tools. Easily make every image express more with a range of special effects: you can preview your chosen effect in Live View, and adjust its intensity before you shoot. For even greater control over the look and feel of your images, shoot using Picture Controls to fine-tune settings like contrast and saturation. The Flat Picture Control makes it easier to perfect your movies in post-production. And you can even create and save a custom Picture Control for a characteristic that's all your own. A range of effects in the retouch menu lets you quickly heighten the atmosphere or change the mood of your photos in-camera. And SnapBridge connectivity means you can take advantage of your smartphone or tablet to continue the creative process using your favourite apps.


Snapbridge Connectivity

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

The PENTAX K-70 is an all-weather camera, with a construction that delivers dependable cold-proof performance down to temperatures as low as -10Â°C. It incorporates a newly developed accelerator unit, which performs high-level noise processing in collaboration with the PRIME MII imaging engine and allows super-high-sensitivity photography at a top sensitivity of ISO 102400. It also features a new Hybrid AF system, which harmonizes the advantages of both the image-plane phase-matching AF system and the contrast detection AF system, to assure maximum speed and accuracy of AF operation during Live View shooting.


It even provides a range of advanced features, equivalent to those available on premium models, including the PENTAX-developed Pixel Shift Resolution System; an innovative AA (anti-aliasing) filter simulator with the same moirÃ© reduction effect as an optical AA filter; an optical viewfinder with nearly 100 percent field of view; and a built-in shake reduction mechanism with a shake reduction effect equivalent to approximately 4.5 shutter steps. It also features a built-in wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) module for remote shooting operation and easy transfer of captured images to smartphones and tablets.


The PENTAX K-70âs exterior is designed with comfortable outdoor shooting in mind. Its user-friendly features include a newly designed grip, redesigned mode dial and control buttons on the cameraâs top and rear panels to ensure exceptional handling and operation. It also comes equipped with an outdoor-friendly LCD monitor on which the brightness of the screen can be adjusted according to the light levels of the shooting location.


Super-high-resolution images captured with approximately 24.24 effective megapixels up to ISO 102400
The PENTAX K-70 features a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor with approximately 24.24 effective megapixels to assure high-speed 14-bit image data readout. Combined with an AA-filter-free optical design, this image sensor delivers super-high-resolution images. Also, by coupling a newly developed accelerator unit with the high-speed PRIME MII imaging engine, the PENTAX K-70 effectively minimizes noise at all sensitivity levels, and captures rich-gradation, fine-detailed images even in super-high-sensitivity shooting at a top sensitivity of ISO 102400.


Hybrid AF system for high-speed AF operation during Live View shooting
The PENTAX K-70 employs PENTAXâs first Hybrid AF system during Live View autofocus operation. By positioning a contrast-detection AF sensor with superior focusing accuracy and a phase-matching AF sensor on the image sensorâs surface, this innovative hybrid system optimizes the benefits of both AF systems to deliver high-speed, pinpoint AF focusing on the subject.


Dustproof, weather-resistant body perfect for rugged outdoor photography
The PENTAX K-70 is a dependable performer even in demanding  situations, such as in the rain or at locations prone to dust or freezing temperatures, It combines a compact, easy-to-carry body in a dustproof, weather-resistant construction delivering outstanding cold-proof performance at temperatures down to -10Â°C. It has also been designed for active outdoor shooting â such as mountain climbing, camping and a range of sporting situations. The improved handling of the camera was achieved by the design of a new grip, and a complete design review of the mode dial and control buttons. In addition to its outdoor-friendly LCD monitor, on which the brightness of the screen can be adjusted according to the light levels of the shooting location, it also features a red-lit monitor display function, which works to the photographerâs eye when it has become accustomed to a low-light location, such as during astronomical photography.


High-precision autofocus system with the SAFOX X module
The PENTAX K-70 features the high-precision SAFOX X AF sensor module, for a responsive, dependable autofocus operation. With its 11 sensors, including nine cross-type sensors in the middle, this AF module delivers pinpoint focus on the subject at a minimum brightness level as low as -3 EV. By revising the timing of the AF sensorâs start-up action, the speed of autofocus response has been improved, especially at low-light levels. The focusing accuracy in the AF-C mode has also been enhanced by improving the algorithm for moving objects. The PENTAX K-70 delivers outstanding AF tracking performance for subjects on the move, thanks to advanced features including the Select-area Expansion function, which automatically refocuses on a moving subject after it moves away from the initial point, with the help of the neighbouring points; and an AF Hold function that maintains the initial in-focus point even when the module loses sight of the subject.


Shake-reduction system
Thanks to the built-in PENTAX-original SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism, the PENTAX K-70 effectively minimizes camera shake and delivers sharp, blur-free images, even in camera-shake-prone conditions such as using a telephoto lens, shooting in low-light , or photographing sunset scenes. Using a high-accuracy gyro sensor, it provides a compensation effect of 4.5 shutter steps, a level close to that of premium models. When taking a panning shot, this mechanism automatically detects the direction of the cameraâs movement, and efficiently controls the SR unit to produce the best image possible without requiring any mode switching operation.


Pixel Shift Resolution System with motion correction function
The PENTAX K-70 features the latest super-resolution technology called Pixel Shift Resolution System,* which captures four images of the same scene by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for each image, and then synthesizing them into a single composite image. Compared to the conventional Bayer system, in which each pixel has only a single colour data unit, this innovative system obtains all colour data in each pixel to deliver super-high-resolution images with far more truthful colours and much finer details than those produced by conventional APS-C-size image sensors. This system also provides a motion correction function,** which automatically detects a moving object during continuous shooting and minimizes negative effects during the synthesizing process, in order to accommodate a wider range of scenes and subjects.


Innovative AA filter simulator 
By applying microscopic vibrations to the image sensor unit at the sub-pixel level during image exposure, the PENTAX K-70's AA (anti-aliasing) filter simulator provides the same level of moirÃ© reduction as an optical AA filter. Unlike an optical AA filter, which always creates the identical result, this innovative simulator lets the user switch the AA filter effect on and off to adjust the level of the effect. This means that the ideal effect can be set for a particular scene or subject based on the photographic conditions.


Optical viewfinder with nearly 100-percent field of view
Within its compact body, the PENTAX K-70 incorporates a glass prism finder featuring the same optics and coatings as those used in premium models. With a nearly 100-percent field of view and a magnification of approximately 0.95 times, it provides a wide, bright image field for easy focusing and framing.


High-speed shutter 
With a top shutter speed of 1/6000 second, the PENTAX K-70 captures sharply focused images, even with fast-moving subjects. Coupled with its high-speed continuous shooting function with a top speed of approximately six images per second, it lets the photographer preserve once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunities in beautifully focused images.


Upgraded Full HD movie recording
The PENTAX K-70 captures high-resolution, flawless Full HD movie clips (1920 x 1080 pixels; 60i/30p frame rate) in the H.264 recording format, and records lively stereo sound using a built-in stereo microphone. In combination with compatible lenses, it allows users  to operate the Continuous AF (AF-C) mode* to keep accurate focus on a moving subject, or take advantage of a new aperture control function** to automatically deliver a proper exposure level even in fluctuating lighting conditions during movie recording. It also provides a host of distinctive visual effects for movie production, including the 4K Interval Movie mode that connects a series of 4K-resolution still images at a fixed interval to create a single movie file, and a Star Stream mode to fade in and out the traces of stars to recorded movies.


Vari-angle LCD monitor 
The PENTAX K-70âs vari-angle LCD monitor allows for the positioning of the monitor at any desired angle, making it easier to compose the image in a wide variety of applications, such as high-angle shooting done at armâs length, or low-angle shots taken from ground level. It also features a unique air-gapless construction, in which the air space between LCD layers is eliminated to effectively reduce the reflection and dispersion of light for improved visibility during outdoor shooting.


Wi-Fi connection to support smartphone operation
The PENTAX K-70 provides a host of wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) functions to support operations using smartphones and tablets. By installing the dedicated Image Sync application on a mobile device, the user can remotely check the Live View image, capture still images, and adjust camera settings such as aperture, shutter speed and ISO sensitivity to the desired level through the mobile device. Users can also download captured images onto the mobile device, and then upload them on social networking sites.

For extremely high image quality and minimal noise, record movies in the high-bit-rate XAVC S format, which was developed based on the professional XAVC 4K/HD format. It enables Full HD (1920 x 1080) image recording at 50Mbps (60p/50p, 30p/25p, 24p)4 and employs linear PCM sound for high-quality sound recording.


BIONZ Xâ¢ image processing engine
BIONZ X faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, via extra high-speed processing capabilities. Together with front-end Large Scale Integration that accelerates processing, it enables more natural details, more realistic images, richer tonal gradations and lower noise when shooting still images and movies.


Robust magnesium alloy body
The remarkably compact and lightweight body is solidly built to withstand the rigors of shooting in the field. Itâs the ideal blend of light weight, solid reliability and steady handling, thanks to a top cover, front cover and internal structure constructed of rigid magnesium alloy.


Enhanced grip and shutter button
The grip is refined in shape and height to support a more secure grasp of the camera even when a large lens is mounted. This also contributes to more confident operation of the shutter button and dials. Moreover, the shutter button has been reshaped and shifted forward to enable more natural shooting with less camera shake.


High-contrast, high-resolution XGA OLED Tru-Finderâ¢
The viewfinder offers impressive visibility that contributes to stress-free, intuitive operation. You can accurately monitor what will appear in your final images because it faithfully displays the effects of your various camera settings. Moreover, an advanced 3-lens optical system ensures rich tonal gradation and extremely high contrast.


Stable viewfinder image
Monitor the stabilizing effects of camera shake compensation in the viewfinder or LCD screen while shooting still images by pressing the shutter button halfway or magnifying the image, and while shooting movies by entering movie mode. Even when using a telephoto or macro lens, you can fine-tune framing and focusing with stress-free stability.


Convenient tiltable LCD screen
The LCD screen tilts upward approx. 107 degrees and downward approx. 41 degrees to accommodate wide-ranging shooting angles. This flexibility combines with compact mobility to greatly expand your shooting options. Viewing is also clear under direct sunlight thanks to WhiteMagicâ¢ technology that nearly doubles the brightness of the display.


Connect to smartphones and tablets with one touch
Instantly transfer a photo or MP4 movie to your Androidâ¢ smartphone or tablet by simply touching it with the Î±7 II â thanks to built-in Wi-Fi and NFCâ¢ (Near Field Communication)7.

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

Underwater face framing saves you from having to get wet when shooting poolside or at the beach, by taking underwater shots automatically when it detects peopleâs faces.


Sharp focus
Target finding AF incorporated (in Auto mode) gives you sharp focus in every image. It accurately predicts the main subject in your shot, so just by framing your image youâll achieve focus automatically. The focus area is shown on the monitor before you press the shutter, so you know exactly where the main focus of your image will be. For human subjects, faces are the priority for focus.

The tough and durable Sony a7RII features the worldâs first back-illuminated 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with 42.4 megapixels. The Sony Î±7R II takes image resolution, sensitivity (up to ISO 102400) and speedy response to new heights. The Fast Hybrid AF system's dense extra-wide focal plane phase-detection AF coverage keeps a subject in sharp focus entirely throughout the frame, while 5-axis image stabilization reduces blur. High resolution is further enhanced by 4K movie recording featuring full pixel readout without pixel binning.


Back-illuminated full-frame sensor
The Î±7R II has the world's first 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with back-illuminated structure, which achieves approx. 42.4 effective megapixel resolution, widely expanded sensitivity range, and extra-low noise performance. It also has no optical low-pass filter that can compromise sharpness, so fine clarity and detail extend from edge to edge of every frame.


High-speed BIONZ X image processing engine
With detail-reproduction technology to capture the essence of realism, diffraction-reducing technology to maintain clarity even at smaller apertures, and area-specific noise reduction to reduce noise adaptively and reproduce greater detail, the BIONZ X image processing engine finely tunes the image sensor's 42.4-megapixel data, for truer, clearer depiction.


Clearer, more vibrant images
With an outstanding 42.4-megapixel count, the new image sensor in the Î±7R II lets you explore the world in remarkable detail and the camera employs no optical low-pass filter that can compromise high resolution. To reduce image blur, the camera's newly developed reduced-vibration shutter minimizes and Silent Shooting mode eliminates camera shake caused by shutter movement. And a growing family of FE lenses lets you witness more of the incomparable clarity that the sensor delivers from every perspective.


Fast Hybrid AF
The high-performance image sensor enhances Fast Hybrid AF, which far surpasses conventional AF in comprehensiveness, speed and response. The 399 focal plane phase-detection AF points cover 45% of the image area â the most coverage among digital still cameras3 with full-frame image sensors. 25-point contrast-detection AF coverage is also included.


5-axis image stabilization in full-frame glory
This stabilization system is fine-tuned for high-resolution image sensors to compensate accurately for five types of camera shake that can compromise handheld shooting of the camera's 42.4-megapixel images. Camera shake compensation is equivalent to using a 4.5-step4 faster shutter speed, allowing you to take advantage of a wider range of shutter speeds.


Higher-resolution 4K movie recording
Footage from 4K movie recording featuring full pixel readout without pixel binning in the Super 35mm format exhibits higher resolution and superior clarity than typical 4K movies. Also, the XAVC S5 format allows 4K recording at 100 Mbps maximum bit rate to capture fine details of movement in movies.


Tough magnesium alloy body
Designed for solid reliability and steady handling, the Î±7R II's compact body is built to withstand the rigors of shooting in the field, thanks to an internal structure and top, front, and rear covers all made of strong, rigid magnesium alloy.


XGA OLED Tru-Finder
With the world's highest magnification at 0.78x among digital still camera viewfinders, the XGA OLED Tru-Finder provides views of cutting-edge definition, contrast and depth throughout the entire display. ZEISS T* Coating ensures absolutely minimal reflection on the viewfinder, so the Î±7R II's extraordinary 42.4-megapixel performance is apparent at all times.


Silent Shooting
Silent Shooting features an electronic shutter that causes no vibration, so you can shoot high-resolution images without camera shake. This mode also operates without a sound, so it's very convenient for shooting without disrupting indoor performances and outdoor wildlife, and in all other situations where silence is essential.


Wi-Fi / NFC simplifies sharing
With Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication) built into the Î±7R II, you can instantly transfer a photo or MP4 movie to your Android smartphone or tablet simply by touching it with the camera, then easily upload the photo or movie to your favorite SNS (social networking site).


PlayMemories Camera Apps add personal touches
Sony's application download service lets you add new functions and capabilities to your camera. There are apps for photo and movie effects to enhance and express your creativity, and others to allow your smartphone to function as a camera's remote control, for example.


Stable viewfinder image
You can monitor the stabilizing effects of camera shake compensation in the viewfinder or LCD screen while shooting still images by pressing the shutter button halfway or magnifying the image, and while shooting movies by entering movie mode. Even when using a telephoto or macro lens, you can fine-tune framing and focusing without stress for steady results.

The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is a tough, compact and lightweight 16 megapixel Interchangeable Lens Camera and  is the successor to the award winning OM-D E-M5. The E-M5 Mark II boasts the worldâs most powerful IS 5-axis in-body Image Stabilization system (as of December 2014)  for blur-free video and still shooting without a tripod.
It's equivalent to 5 steps faster shutter speed - that translates to startling low-light image quality. The Olympus E-M5 II also includes a 40 megapixel, high-res composite shot function for incredible still images. 


A new OM-D Movie Mode offers multiple video frame rates and Full HD video up to 77 Mbps while an ergonomic, user friendly design makes the E-M5 Mark II simple to use. With a 3-inch vari-angle LCD touchscreen and large electronic viewfinder, you'll get a crystal-clear view of any shooting situation. The built-in Wi-Fi enables remote shooting and easy sharing of your images via a smartphone.


Unique 5-axis Image Stabilisation (IS) systemThe Olympus E-M5 Mark II features the worldâs most powerful 5-axis Image Stabilisation system. The new, evolved eliminates camera-shake in all five planes of movement, achieving the equivalent of 5 EV steps faster shutter speed. Plus, itâs built into the body of the camera, so it works with any lens. Even in low-light conditions and with a telephoto lens, 5-axis IS ensures the E-M5 shoots blur-free. That goes for video and stills.


Solid, Ergonomic design
The magnesium alloy housing feels reassuringly solid and stable whilst being compact & lightweight. The E-M5 is dustproof splash- and freezeproof so it's ideal for the outdoors. 


The OM-D E-M5 Mark II comes with intelligently laid-out controls that simplify access to the vast array of options. That means attention to design details, both large and small. For instance, the Fn buttons on the top of the E-M5 Mark II and the function dial that protrudes slightly higher than usual.


Outstanding video
In OM-D Movie Mode, the Mark II records at high bitrates up to 77 Mbps, and offers a wide variety of 1080 Full HD formats to match your frame rate of choice â 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p or the classic 24p preferred by many narrative filmmakers. Focusing during video capture is straightforward, via a 3-inch touch-sensitive, vari-angle LCD screen.


Vari-angle touchscreen display & EVF
When youâre shooting from awkward angles, this 1.04 million-dot vari-angle display can swivel and tilt to ensure a bright and clear view of any scene. Equally advantageous is the large, bright, 2.36 million-dot Electronic Viewfinder that automatically switches on when it detects your eye. It reveals a clearly laid-out menu of key settings than can be adjusted before you release the shutter.


40 Megapixel stills 
Another advantage of Olympusâ ultra-precise 5-axis stabilisation system is the potential to capture extremely high-resolution still images that exceed the normal capacity of its 16-Megapixel LIVE MOS sensor. By moving the sensor by 0.5 pixel steps between each shot and merging eight single exposures into one, the E-M5 Mark II delivers a 40-Megapixel image with breathtaking levels of detail and radiance. Little wonder OM-D is known for the best images Olympus cameras have ever created. Another key component in this spectacular visual performance is the processing engine. The  E-M5 Mark II now uses the same TruePic VII processor as the top-of-the-range OM-D E-M1. 


Effects and features
Although remarkably small and easy to handle, the E-M5 Mark II is packed with clever options that urge you to let your creativity off the leash. Live Composite, which combines several images in the camera, is ideal for passage-of-time shots that trace the movement of bright objects such as stars, fireworks or handheld light-painting devices. Alternatively, shoot burst sequences at 10fps and take advantage of a 1/16000 shutter speed. In-camera keystone compensation allows for correcting converging verticals in Live View, without the need for a shift lens or post-processing. With a host of art filters, you can add a layer of special effects while built-in WiFi means you can remote control the Mark II from a smartphone, then share and geotag the images on social media using Olympus OI.Share â an invaluable facility in a variety of shooting situations. These are just a few highlights from a long list of enhancements that make the next-gen E-M5 one of the most versatile and ergonomically sophisticated cameras in the category.

The tough and durable Sony a7RII features the worldâs first back-illuminated 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with 42.4 megapixels. The Sony Î±7R II takes image resolution, sensitivity (up to ISO 102400) and speedy response to new heights. The Fast Hybrid AF system's dense extra-wide focal plane phase-detection AF coverage keeps a subject in sharp focus entirely throughout the frame, while 5-axis image stabilization reduces blur. High resolution is further enhanced by 4K movie recording featuring full pixel readout without pixel binning.


Back-illuminated full-frame sensor
The Î±7R II has the world's first 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with back-illuminated structure, which achieves approx. 42.4 effective megapixel resolution, widely expanded sensitivity range, and extra-low noise performance. It also has no optical low-pass filter that can compromise sharpness, so fine clarity and detail extend from edge to edge of every frame.


High-speed BIONZ X image processing engine
With detail-reproduction technology to capture the essence of realism, diffraction-reducing technology to maintain clarity even at smaller apertures, and area-specific noise reduction to reduce noise adaptively and reproduce greater detail, the BIONZ X image processing engine finely tunes the image sensor's 42.4-megapixel data, for truer, clearer depiction.


Clearer, more vibrant images
With an outstanding 42.4-megapixel count, the new image sensor in the Î±7R II lets you explore the world in remarkable detail and the camera employs no optical low-pass filter that can compromise high resolution. To reduce image blur, the camera's newly developed reduced-vibration shutter minimizes and Silent Shooting mode eliminates camera shake caused by shutter movement. And a growing family of FE lenses lets you witness more of the incomparable clarity that the sensor delivers from every perspective.


Fast Hybrid AF
The high-performance image sensor enhances Fast Hybrid AF, which far surpasses conventional AF in comprehensiveness, speed and response. The 399 focal plane phase-detection AF points cover 45% of the image area â the most coverage among digital still cameras3 with full-frame image sensors. 25-point contrast-detection AF coverage is also included.


5-axis image stabilization in full-frame glory
This stabilization system is fine-tuned for high-resolution image sensors to compensate accurately for five types of camera shake that can compromise handheld shooting of the camera's 42.4-megapixel images. Camera shake compensation is equivalent to using a 4.5-step4 faster shutter speed, allowing you to take advantage of a wider range of shutter speeds.


Higher-resolution 4K movie recording
Footage from 4K movie recording featuring full pixel readout without pixel binning in the Super 35mm format exhibits higher resolution and superior clarity than typical 4K movies. Also, the XAVC S5 format allows 4K recording at 100 Mbps maximum bit rate to capture fine details of movement in movies.


Tough magnesium alloy body
Designed for solid reliability and steady handling, the Î±7R II's compact body is built to withstand the rigors of shooting in the field, thanks to an internal structure and top, front, and rear covers all made of strong, rigid magnesium alloy.


XGA OLED Tru-Finder
With the world's highest magnification at 0.78x among digital still camera viewfinders, the XGA OLED Tru-Finder provides views of cutting-edge definition, contrast and depth throughout the entire display. ZEISS T* Coating ensures absolutely minimal reflection on the viewfinder, so the Î±7R II's extraordinary 42.4-megapixel performance is apparent at all times.


Silent Shooting
Silent Shooting features an electronic shutter that causes no vibration, so you can shoot high-resolution images without camera shake. This mode also operates without a sound, so it's very convenient for shooting without disrupting indoor performances and outdoor wildlife, and in all other situations where silence is essential.


Wi-Fi / NFC simplifies sharing
With Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication) built into the Î±7R II, you can instantly transfer a photo or MP4 movie to your Android smartphone or tablet simply by touching it with the camera, then easily upload the photo or movie to your favorite SNS (social networking site).


PlayMemories Camera Apps add personal touches
Sony's application download service lets you add new functions and capabilities to your camera. There are apps for photo and movie effects to enhance and express your creativity, and others to allow your smartphone to function as a camera's remote control, for example.


Stable viewfinder image
You can monitor the stabilizing effects of camera shake compensation in the viewfinder or LCD screen while shooting still images by pressing the shutter button halfway or magnifying the image, and while shooting movies by entering movie mode. Even when using a telephoto or macro lens, you can fine-tune framing and focusing without stress for steady results.

It also produces high quality images across the entire sensitivity range.


Effective camera shake compensation
The PENTAX KP comes equipped with the innovative sensor shift SR II (Shake Reduction II), which ensures optimum compensation effect for all lenses. In addition to common camera shake caused by pitch and yaw, this five-axis mechanism also compensates for camera shake caused by horizontal and vertical shift (often generated in macro photography). Also camera shake caused by roll, which is difficult to handle by in-lens shake reduction systems. Thanks to a wide compensation range of five shutter steps, it benefits a number of handheld applications, such as when using a telephoto lens or shooting in poorly lit locations, to capture sharp, blur-free images.


New APS-C CMOS image sensor
The PENTAX KP incorporates a new-generation, APS-C CMOS image sensor with approximately 24.32 effective megapixels to produce high resolution images. It has been engineered to remove the optical AA (anti-aliasing) filter to optimise the image sensorâs outstanding imaging power. The result is sharp, fine detailed images with an accurate sense of depth. By processing image data at a high read-out speed of 14bit, it produces beautiful, rich gradation images.


Dustproof, weather-resistant construction
To prevent the intrusion of water and dust into the interior, the PENTAX KP features 67 sealing parts, applied to the control buttons and dials, covers and exterior joints. By mounting an AW- or WR-series lens* and the optional, weather-resistant D-BG7 battery grip, they form a highly airtight digital imaging system that assures dependable performance even under unfavorable weather conditions.

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is a tough, compact and lightweight 16 megapixel Interchangeable Lens Camera and  is the successor to the award winning OM-D E-M5. The E-M5 Mark II boasts the worldâs most powerful IS 5-axis in-body Image Stabilization system (as of December 2014)  for blur-free video and still shooting without a tripod.
It's equivalent to 5 steps faster shutter speed - that translates to startling low-light image quality. The Olympus E-M5 II also includes a 40 megapixel, high-res composite shot function for incredible still images. 


A new OM-D Movie Mode offers multiple video frame rates and Full HD video up to 77 Mbps while an ergonomic, user friendly design makes the E-M5 Mark II simple to use. With a 3-inch vari-angle LCD touchscreen and large electronic viewfinder, you'll get a crystal-clear view of any shooting situation. The built-in Wi-Fi enables remote shooting and easy sharing of your images via a smartphone.


Unique 5-axis Image Stabilisation (IS) systemThe Olympus E-M5 Mark II features the worldâs most powerful 5-axis Image Stabilisation system. The new, evolved eliminates camera-shake in all five planes of movement, achieving the equivalent of 5 EV steps faster shutter speed. Plus, itâs built into the body of the camera, so it works with any lens. Even in low-light conditions and with a telephoto lens, 5-axis IS ensures the E-M5 shoots blur-free. That goes for video and stills.


Solid, Ergonomic design
The magnesium alloy housing feels reassuringly solid and stable whilst being compact & lightweight. The E-M5 is dustproof splash- and freezeproof so it's ideal for the outdoors. 


The OM-D E-M5 Mark II comes with intelligently laid-out controls that simplify access to the vast array of options. That means attention to design details, both large and small. For instance, the Fn buttons on the top of the E-M5 Mark II and the function dial that protrudes slightly higher than usual.


Outstanding video
In OM-D Movie Mode, the Mark II records at high bitrates up to 77 Mbps, and offers a wide variety of 1080 Full HD formats to match your frame rate of choice â 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p or the classic 24p preferred by many narrative filmmakers. Focusing during video capture is straightforward, via a 3-inch touch-sensitive, vari-angle LCD screen.


Vari-angle touchscreen display & EVF
When youâre shooting from awkward angles, this 1.04 million-dot vari-angle display can swivel and tilt to ensure a bright and clear view of any scene. Equally advantageous is the large, bright, 2.36 million-dot Electronic Viewfinder that automatically switches on when it detects your eye. It reveals a clearly laid-out menu of key settings than can be adjusted before you release the shutter.


40 Megapixel stills 
Another advantage of Olympusâ ultra-precise 5-axis stabilisation system is the potential to capture extremely high-resolution still images that exceed the normal capacity of its 16-Megapixel LIVE MOS sensor. By moving the sensor by 0.5 pixel steps between each shot and merging eight single exposures into one, the E-M5 Mark II delivers a 40-Megapixel image with breathtaking levels of detail and radiance. Little wonder OM-D is known for the best images Olympus cameras have ever created. Another key component in this spectacular visual performance is the processing engine. The  E-M5 Mark II now uses the same TruePic VII processor as the top-of-the-range OM-D E-M1. 


Effects and features
Although remarkably small and easy to handle, the E-M5 Mark II is packed with clever options that urge you to let your creativity off the leash. Live Composite, which combines several images in the camera, is ideal for passage-of-time shots that trace the movement of bright objects such as stars, fireworks or handheld light-painting devices. Alternatively, shoot burst sequences at 10fps and take advantage of a 1/16000 shutter speed. In-camera keystone compensation allows for correcting converging verticals in Live View, without the need for a shift lens or post-processing. With a host of art filters, you can add a layer of special effects while built-in WiFi means you can remote control the Mark II from a smartphone, then share and geotag the images on social media using Olympus OI.Share â an invaluable facility in a variety of shooting situations. These are just a few highlights from a long list of enhancements that make the next-gen E-M5 one of the most versatile and ergonomically sophisticated cameras in the category.

The Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G80 is the successor to the Panasonic G7 and includes the same 16 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor as the G7 but with no AA filter.
The Lumix G8 also upgrades with a new Venus Engine, 2.36M dot OLED Electronic Viewfinder with increased magnification and longer eyepoint, in-body 5-axis Dual image stabilization and new in-camera focus-stacking mode. The rugged magnesium body construction is splashproof and dustproof, so it's ideal for outdoor everyday use. Easy Wireless Connectivity via Wi-Fi lets you connect with your smartphone.





Stunning clarity with every shot 
.The new LUMIX DMC-G80 features an updated Image Stabilization system â the 5-axis Dual I.S. MK II  By incorporating new gyro-sensor technology, the O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) and B.I.S. (Body Image Stabilizer, 5-axis) are able to work in perfect harmony and with outstanding accuracy. With improved suppression of blur, resulting pictures and videos remain beautifully crisp despite vibrations caused by shaking hands or traversing outdoor terrain. 


With the LUMIX DMC-G80âs ability to analyse shooting conditions, including focal length, the new Dual I.S. system is able to utilise max. 5-stop slower shutter speed . Users can also enjoy blur-free photo/video shooting in both wide angle and telephoto, even in low light situations or when shooting with one hand. 


To further minimise unwanted vibration, the LUMIX DMC-G80 also utilises an electromagnetic drive in the shutter unit. The shock caused by the movement of shutter diaphragm is dramatically reduced and shutter sound is also minimised. Together with the adoption of solid magnesium for the front panel, shutter vibration is reduced by approx. 90% compared with the DMC-G80âs predecessor, the G7.


Power to deliver the highest quality
The 16.0-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor and new Venus Engine combine to allow users to shoot vibrant, true-to-life high quality images with excellent resolution, high contrast, impressive colour reproduction and max. ISO 25600 high sensitivity.


By removing the Low Pass Filter from the DMC-G80âs sensor, the limiting resolution is improved by approx. 10%. At the same time, the Venus Engine reproduces vibrant, impressive colour â such as clear sky â by dividing hue, saturation and luminosity and finely adjusting them individually. Taking advantage of this fine tuning capability, the LUMIX G80 enables users to choose a pre-set of contrast, sharpness, saturation and noise reduction that suits their environment and shooting style.


Panasonicâs LUMIX G cameras are not only renowned for their still image quality, but also for their high quality video capability in 4K. The LUMIX DMC-G80 records stunningly smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K video in 3840x2160 at 25p (50Hz) or 24p in MP4 in addition to full-HD 1,920 x 1,080 at 50p (50 Hz) videos in AVCHD Progressive or MP4 (MPEG-4 / H.264) format with practical full-time AF.


Capture those photo opportunities 
Utilising the LUMIX DMC-G80âs exceptional 4K video recording capability, the 4K Photo function allows users to extract an 8-megapixel still with exact precision, enabling even the most fleeting moment to be caught in a still image.


Three exclusive 4K Photo functions are integrated into the LUMIX DMC-G80: 4K Burst Shooting, 4K Burst (Start/Stop) and 4K Pre-burst; all of which help allow photographers to capture and record that perfect picture by cropping the exact frame they want out from the recorded 4K video footage.


In addition to 4K Photo, the DMC-G80âs contrast AF achieves even faster and more precise focusing with digital signal communication at max. 240 fps. The Contrast AF system in the LUMIX DMC-G80 is further enhanced by Panasonicâs integration of Depth From Defocus (DFD) technology  which shortens the focusing time even further. 


Even if focus is not exactly as the user intended when the shutter is pressed, the LUMIX DMC-G80 also comes with the Post Focus function that enables users to select the specific focal point even after shooting â particularly helpful in situations like macro shooting where severe focusing is required. The camera now supports a Focus Stacking function. As taking a single macro photo with specific areas in focus can sometimes be difficult, Focus Stacking enables users to take multiple images of the same frame with different aperture values, then combine them into one image and select the area to be in focus.


In addition, Low Light AF makes it possible to set focus on the subject more precisely in extremely low-lit situations (-4EV) such as wildlife photography at dawn or dusk, while Starlight AF, allows budding astronomers to capture individual stars and constellations in the night sky.


Tough and versatile design
To withstand the demands of heavy field use, the DMC-G80 adopts rugged design with a full die-cast magnesium front frame. It also features splash and dustproof construction thanks to the careful sealing on every joint, dial and button.


To further enhance control, the LUMIX DMC-G80 comes with ergonomically-designed thick grip for a stable holding even in one hand. The front/rear dual dial system enables direct setting. For example, users can adjust white balance with a front dial and set ISO with a rear dial while choosing the shutter speed or monitoring the noise effect on the rear screen â ideal when dealing with complex lighting situations.


The DMC-G80 boasts a large 2,360K-dot OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) LVF (Live View Finder) with a magnification ratio of approx. 1.48x / 0.74x (35mm camera equiv.) and 100% field of view. It delivers high speed response with minimum time lag of less than 0.01 sec as well as 10,000:1 high contrast for exceptional visibility, plus, the eye point of approximately 20 mm offers high visibility and comfort even for users wearing glasses.


The LVF also comes with a new Power Save Mode. If the sensor detects that the eye has moved away from the LVF, the camera automatically enters sleep mode after 3, 5 or 10 seconds. When the shutter button is half pressed, it instantly switches back into shooting mode. This feature helps to increase the amount of shots that can be taken with one battery charge by almost three times, from 320 to 800-900. 


Adopting a static-type touch control system, the 3-inch (7,62cm), 1040K-dot, free-angle rear screen is easy and intuitively to control. It also tilts vertically by 270-degree, which makes shooting overhead or at low angles even easier.

Improved focusing
With 61 points the 5D Mark IV has the same number of autofocus (AF) points as the 5D Mark III, but the AF system has been given a refresh and made similar to the one in the flagship Canon EOS 1DX Mark II. Of the 61 points, 41 are the more sensitive cross-type, with 21 of those being cross-type with maximum apertures as small as f/8. There are also 5 points that are dual cross-type at f/8. Having more cross-type points makes the 5D Mark IV better than the Mark III at detecting subjects, and making the system sensitive down to f/8 means it works better when teleconverters are used to extend the reach of telephoto lenses. Anti-flicker technology combats variations in brightness under artificial lighting.


Engineered to perform

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

30.4 Megapixel Full-frame CMOS Sensor
Shoot captivating stills wherever you are, day or night. 30.4-megapixel resolution delivers extraordinary detail.


Improved focusing
With 61 points the 5D Mark IV has the same number of autofocus (AF) points as the 5D Mark III, but the AF system has been given a refresh and made similar to the one in the flagship Canon EOS 1DX Mark II. Of the 61 points, 41 are the more sensitive cross-type, with 21 of those being cross-type with maximum apertures as small as f/8. There are also 5 points that are dual cross-type at f/8. Having more cross-type points makes the 5D Mark IV better than the Mark III at detecting subjects, and making the system sensitive down to f/8 means it works better when teleconverters are used to extend the reach of telephoto lenses. Anti-flicker technology combats variations in brightness under artificial lighting.


Engineered to perform
In pursuit of the perfect moment, the EOS 5D MARK IV can shoot continuously at 7fps. Its viewfinder and user interface are highly customisable, with intuitive touch-screen operation offering new levels of camera control.

Since the engine that powers conversion is as important as your lens and sensor, the RX10 II features the high-speed BIONZ X processor for more natural details, more realistic images, richer tonal gradations, and lower noise while shooting photos and movies.


ZEISSÂ® Vario-Sonnar T* F2.8 zoom lens
ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* zoom lens provides a constant F2.8 large aperture throughout the 24â200 mm zooming range. Composed of 7 aspherical elements, this lens captures awesome close-ups and transforms movies and stills into works of art. Pro-style Manual Ring works as a zoom and aperture controller (with click sound on/off for silent operation), etc.


Direct 4K movie recording via camera alone
The RX10 II can record high-precision 4K movie data directly on a memory card inserted into the body while suppressing moirÃ© and jaggies. A front-end LSI that handles mass volume data through full-pixel readout at higher speed lets the camera suppress image distortion of moving subjects due to the rolling shutter phenomenon.


pro-quality XAVC S4 or AVCHD movie recording
Especially for serious videographers, XAVC S format provides low compression for high-quality movie expression and minimal noise even in scenes full of movement. You also have AVCHD format for easy editing and sharing. This camera uses 4K codec supporting 4K movie recording at up to 100 Mbps and additionally enables Full HD image recording.


Dual Rec still shooting during movie recording
Shoot still images of 17 MP while recording a movie. The camera enables you to capture impressive high-quality stills even if shooting movies. New Auto Dual Rec release function lets the camera automatically take photos during movie recording. Select frequency of Auto Dual Rec release from high/standard/low settings.


Super slow motion at maximum of 40x
Using the mode dial to select HFR, itâs easy to create super slow motion movies containing split-second moments of action. Choose shooting frame rates of 960/1000fps, 480/500fps, or 240/250fps (NTSC/PAL), depending on which is most suitable for your needs.ãThe end trigger mode also enables you to capture 2 or 4 seconds before the MOVIE button is pressed, letting you capture the decisive moment.


Super-high-speed shutter of 1/32000 sec.
This next-generation 1/32000 super-high-speed Anti-Distortion Shutter works to minimize image distortion caused by the rolling shutter phenomenon. The extraordinarily fast shutter speed also allows you to produce photos with background defocusing using a large aperture setting even under extremely bright conditions at a maximum of EV19.


Quick precision autofocusing up to 0.09 sec.
AF performance of the RX10 II reaches speeds as fast as 0.09 second. To help you capture momentary shutter opportunities without fail, the adaptable lens also provides the rapid, reliable Direct Drive Super Sonicwave Motor (SSM) for smooth and highly precise focus driving that works together with Fast Intelligent AF.


Bright XGA OLED Tru-Finder
High-contrast electronic viewfinder (EVF) delivers high resolution equivalent to 2359k dots. Stunning resolution and self-illumination allow the subtlest details to be displayed for precise composition.


Up to 14fps continuous shooting
Thanks to the new super-high-speed image sensorâand despite its 20.2 MP high pixel countâthe camera features accelerated readout speed that helps achieve continuous shooting up to 14fps10. This lets you capture moments of fleeting beauty or facial expressions.

Sitting above the Olympus PEN E-P5 and complementing the OM-D range of cameras, the Olympus PEN-F is undeniably in a class of its own. It  features a High Visibility electronic viewfinder: this is the first PEN to boast one in a rangefinder style, allowing photographers to accurately preview creative effects or exposure before capture.


1/8000sec shutter speed gets you results in the brightest of conditions, while ISO LOW (equivalent of ISO 80) picks out detail in the dark. A brand new 20 megapixel sensor beats at the heart of the PEN F which will excite those obsessed with image quality.


The PEN-F has Wi-Fi support and access to Olympus' excellent O.I Share app technology, allowing you to wirelessly transfer shots to your smartphone or tablet for immediate upload to social media.


The front dial next to the lens allows you to switch between different creative modes and access Olympus' trademark Art Filters extremely quickly.





High Visibility Viewfinder
The PEN-F is the first OLYMPUS PEN with an electronic viewfinder in a rangefinder style. 
The effects of all features like the Art Filters or the Monochrome Profile Control can be examined before you take a photo with a certain setting. Moreover, with the new viewfinder you can see if your photo is going to be underexposed or overexposed, which gives you the chance to take countermeasures.


Image Quality
In general, image quality is affected by the lens,
the processor, and the sensor. For the PEN-F, Olympus created a fourth factor: the 5-axis image
stabilization. Thanks to that feature, you can work
over a lengthy period with low sensitivities, so that
it is much easier to take a photo without blurring.
Furthermore, the new 21 megapixel image sensor ensures a
resolution that leaves nothing to be desired.


Another feature of the camera: the 50 megapixel HighRes Shot. This high res mode was especially created for the work with tripods and still life photography. Getting eight shots by taking one picture increases the resolution and leads to clear and crisp details.


Quick Response
an important feature of this camera. After all, you
appreciate a camera that takes a picture in the very moment you press the shutter button. No one likes those cameras that take a picture when the moment you wanted to remember forever is over. That is why the response time of the Olympus PEN-F is stunningly short. No other camera has a shorter release time.


Creative Dial
With t he new Creative Dial you get direct access to two
new features that have never been used before in combination with a camera: the Monochrome Profile
Control and the Colour Profile Control.


With the Monochrome Profile Control you can set different effects â like the Monochrome-Filter-Effect
that imitates classical photo filters and also includes a gradation curve. Would you like to have darker
shadows or a brighter light? A piece of cake with this new feature of the Olympus PEN-F.


With the Colour Profile Control, you can change the colour saturation of 12 different colours. Favorite settings can be reused again and again. With t he Creative Dial you can also choose between 14 Art Filters and get access to the Colour Creator. And thanks to the new interface, choosing these effects is faster and clearer than ever.

The tough and durable Sony a7RII features the worldâs first back-illuminated 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with 42.4 megapixels. The Sony Î±7R II takes image resolution, sensitivity (up to ISO 102400) and speedy response to new heights. The Fast Hybrid AF system's dense extra-wide focal plane phase-detection AF coverage keeps a subject in sharp focus entirely throughout the frame, while 5-axis image stabilization reduces blur. High resolution is further enhanced by 4K movie recording featuring full pixel readout without pixel binning.


Back-illuminated full-frame sensor
The Î±7R II has the world's first 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with back-illuminated structure, which achieves approx. 42.4 effective megapixel resolution, widely expanded sensitivity range, and extra-low noise performance. It also has no optical low-pass filter that can compromise sharpness, so fine clarity and detail extend from edge to edge of every frame.


High-speed BIONZ X image processing engine
With detail-reproduction technology to capture the essence of realism, diffraction-reducing technology to maintain clarity even at smaller apertures, and area-specific noise reduction to reduce noise adaptively and reproduce greater detail, the BIONZ X image processing engine finely tunes the image sensor's 42.4-megapixel data, for truer, clearer depiction.


Clearer, more vibrant images
With an outstanding 42.4-megapixel count, the new image sensor in the Î±7R II lets you explore the world in remarkable detail and the camera employs no optical low-pass filter that can compromise high resolution. To reduce image blur, the camera's newly developed reduced-vibration shutter minimizes and Silent Shooting mode eliminates camera shake caused by shutter movement. And a growing family of FE lenses lets you witness more of the incomparable clarity that the sensor delivers from every perspective.


Fast Hybrid AF
The high-performance image sensor enhances Fast Hybrid AF, which far surpasses conventional AF in comprehensiveness, speed and response. The 399 focal plane phase-detection AF points cover 45% of the image area â the most coverage among digital still cameras3 with full-frame image sensors. 25-point contrast-detection AF coverage is also included.


5-axis image stabilization in full-frame glory
This stabilization system is fine-tuned for high-resolution image sensors to compensate accurately for five types of camera shake that can compromise handheld shooting of the camera's 42.4-megapixel images. Camera shake compensation is equivalent to using a 4.5-step4 faster shutter speed, allowing you to take advantage of a wider range of shutter speeds.


Higher-resolution 4K movie recording
Footage from 4K movie recording featuring full pixel readout without pixel binning in the Super 35mm format exhibits higher resolution and superior clarity than typical 4K movies. Also, the XAVC S5 format allows 4K recording at 100 Mbps maximum bit rate to capture fine details of movement in movies.


Tough magnesium alloy body
Designed for solid reliability and steady handling, the Î±7R II's compact body is built to withstand the rigors of shooting in the field, thanks to an internal structure and top, front, and rear covers all made of strong, rigid magnesium alloy.


XGA OLED Tru-Finder
With the world's highest magnification at 0.78x among digital still camera viewfinders, the XGA OLED Tru-Finder provides views of cutting-edge definition, contrast and depth throughout the entire display. ZEISS T* Coating ensures absolutely minimal reflection on the viewfinder, so the Î±7R II's extraordinary 42.4-megapixel performance is apparent at all times.


Silent Shooting
Silent Shooting features an electronic shutter that causes no vibration, so you can shoot high-resolution images without camera shake. This mode also operates without a sound, so it's very convenient for shooting without disrupting indoor performances and outdoor wildlife, and in all other situations where silence is essential.


Wi-Fi / NFC simplifies sharing
With Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication) built into the Î±7R II, you can instantly transfer a photo or MP4 movie to your Android smartphone or tablet simply by touching it with the camera, then easily upload the photo or movie to your favorite SNS (social networking site).


PlayMemories Camera Apps add personal touches
Sony's application download service lets you add new functions and capabilities to your camera. There are apps for photo and movie effects to enhance and express your creativity, and others to allow your smartphone to function as a camera's remote control, for example.


Stable viewfinder image
You can monitor the stabilizing effects of camera shake compensation in the viewfinder or LCD screen while shooting still images by pressing the shutter button halfway or magnifying the image, and while shooting movies by entering movie mode.

AF-C Custom Settings for moving subjects
The X-T20 features AF-C Custom Settings where you can choose from five AF-C presets according to the way your chosen subject is moving. The AF algorithm has been revised for improved accuracy, resulting in a dramatic improvement when tracking a moving subject in the AF-C mode.


High resolution and high definition 4K video recording
The X-T20 is capable of recording both Full HD and 4K video using the X Seriesâ famous Film Simulation effects. You can output recorded video to an external monitor via the HDMI port and input audio from an external microphone.


Intuitive operation with the touchscreen display
The LCD monitor uses a capacitive touchscreen panel to facilitate high-angle shots, taken from above a crowd of people or an obstacle, as well as low-angle shots simulating the perspective of small children or pets. 


Improved AF performance for the moving subjects
The number of focusing points has been dramatically expanded from 49 in the previous model to 91 (up to 325 points).  Approx. 40% of the imaging area (the centre area containing 49 focusing points) is covered with phase detection AF pixels to form a fast and precise phase detection AF area that can be used in a variety of scenes.

The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is a tough, compact and lightweight 16 megapixel Interchangeable Lens Camera and  is the successor to the award winning OM-D E-M5. The E-M5 Mark II boasts the worldâs most powerful IS 5-axis in-body Image Stabilization system (as of December 2014)  for blur-free video and still shooting without a tripod.
It's equivalent to 5 steps faster shutter speed - that translates to startling low-light image quality. The Olympus E-M5 II also includes a 40 megapixel, high-res composite shot function for incredible still images. 


A new OM-D Movie Mode offers multiple video frame rates and Full HD video up to 77 Mbps while an ergonomic, user friendly design makes the E-M5 Mark II simple to use. With a 3-inch vari-angle LCD touchscreen and large electronic viewfinder, you'll get a crystal-clear view of any shooting situation. The built-in Wi-Fi enables remote shooting and easy sharing of your images via a smartphone.


Unique 5-axis Image Stabilisation (IS) systemThe Olympus E-M5 Mark II features the worldâs most powerful 5-axis Image Stabilisation system. The new, evolved eliminates camera-shake in all five planes of movement, achieving the equivalent of 5 EV steps faster shutter speed. Plus, itâs built into the body of the camera, so it works with any lens. Even in low-light conditions and with a telephoto lens, 5-axis IS ensures the E-M5 shoots blur-free. That goes for video and stills.


Solid, Ergonomic design
The magnesium alloy housing feels reassuringly solid and stable whilst being compact & lightweight. The E-M5 is dustproof splash- and freezeproof so it's ideal for the outdoors. 


The OM-D E-M5 Mark II comes with intelligently laid-out controls that simplify access to the vast array of options. That means attention to design details, both large and small. For instance, the Fn buttons on the top of the E-M5 Mark II and the function dial that protrudes slightly higher than usual.


Outstanding video
In OM-D Movie Mode, the Mark II records at high bitrates up to 77 Mbps, and offers a wide variety of 1080 Full HD formats to match your frame rate of choice â 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p or the classic 24p preferred by many narrative filmmakers. Focusing during video capture is straightforward, via a 3-inch touch-sensitive, vari-angle LCD screen.


Vari-angle touchscreen display & EVF
When youâre shooting from awkward angles, this 1.04 million-dot vari-angle display can swivel and tilt to ensure a bright and clear view of any scene. Equally advantageous is the large, bright, 2.36 million-dot Electronic Viewfinder that automatically switches on when it detects your eye. It reveals a clearly laid-out menu of key settings than can be adjusted before you release the shutter.


40 Megapixel stills 
Another advantage of Olympusâ ultra-precise 5-axis stabilisation system is the potential to capture extremely high-resolution still images that exceed the normal capacity of its 16-Megapixel LIVE MOS sensor. By moving the sensor by 0.5 pixel steps between each shot and merging eight single exposures into one, the E-M5 Mark II delivers a 40-Megapixel image with breathtaking levels of detail and radiance. Little wonder OM-D is known for the best images Olympus cameras have ever created. Another key component in this spectacular visual performance is the processing engine. The  E-M5 Mark II now uses the same TruePic VII processor as the top-of-the-range OM-D E-M1. 


Effects and features
Although remarkably small and easy to handle, the E-M5 Mark II is packed with clever options that urge you to let your creativity off the leash. Live Composite, which combines several images in the camera, is ideal for passage-of-time shots that trace the movement of bright objects such as stars, fireworks or handheld light-painting devices. Alternatively, shoot burst sequences at 10fps and take advantage of a 1/16000 shutter speed. In-camera keystone compensation allows for correcting converging verticals in Live View, without the need for a shift lens or post-processing. With a host of art filters, you can add a layer of special effects while built-in WiFi means you can remote control the Mark II from a smartphone, then share and geotag the images on social media using Olympus OI.Share â an invaluable facility in a variety of shooting situations. These are just a few highlights from a long list of enhancements that make the next-gen E-M5 one of the most versatile and ergonomically sophisticated cameras in the category.

Itâs cold-resistant down to -10Â°C and dustproof too, letting you carry it with you anywhere without a care. You can just relax and enjoy making photography fun for everyone.


High quality images
Say goodbye to grainy shots and missed moments when you can shoot with a crystal clear NIKKOR lens and a 13.2 MP CMOS image sensor. The NIKKOR 3x optical zoom is extendable to 6x Dynamic Fine Zoom, bringing you closer to your subject so you can shoot all the fun and capture great facial expressions too. High image quality is guaranteed, helping you to shoot images and video that youâll be proud to share.


Easy sharing with Snapbridge
Your high-quality Nikon images can light up your social networks in seconds with SnapBridge. It uses BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (BLE) to maintain a constant, low-power connection between your camera and up to five smart devices. Photos can be automatically transferred to your phone or tablet as you shoot. Simply pick up your smart device and your photos will be there: images synced while you shoot are automatically re-sized so theyâre easy to review, or edit in your favourite app, and quick to upload to social media. If you donât want to automatically sync every photo, simple controls let you manually sync specific photos, transfer images at larger resolutions, and sync movies.


Full HD Video
Make great movies with friends and family at the touch of a button. Just press the dedicated video record button and youâll be shooting Full HD 1080p video with stereo sound. When the action starts youâll always be ready to record memorable moments in motion, while Electronic VR (Vibration Reduction) keeps your movies smooth. You can even play around with a Diorama effect to make your movies look like miniature scenes, and play back on your HDTV with an optional HDMI cable. Bring special celebrations and travel scenes to life in high-quality movies that are perfect for social sharing.


Easy and intuitive operation
When the actionâs happening, the last thing you want to worry about is how to operate your camera, so the COOLPIX W100 makes it easy for you. Four dedicated buttons allow direct access to the menu, while a simple-to-use interface helps you find the feature you need with ease. Buttons are large and friendly to small hands, designed to make shooting comfortable for photographers of all ages. Select Easy auto mode and your camera will optimise all its settings for you, giving you great images every time. The large 230k-dot 6.7cm/2.7in TFT LCD monitor makes framing shots easy, and its anti-reflection coating and brightness adjustment means youâll always have clear visibility â even in low light or direct sunlight. Micro-USB charging gives you a quick recharge time, so youâre always ready to capture that perfect moment.


Family friendly features
The COOLPIX W100 makes shooting simple for even the smallest of photographers with a Variety menu that gives you a choice of adult or child menus. Inside the childrenâs menu, brightly coloured Welcome screens change from day to night, according to the time of shooting. Welcome characters also appear to make shooting even more fun, and children can play with adding cartoon effects or cute stamps like hearts and stars to their images too. Your camera comes in a range of vibrant colours to suit any lifestyle.


Creative effects

You can even add light trails to your photos with Multiple exposure lighten or create a Slide show with sound right in your camera. Never have a dull photo day again!


Perfect portraits
Smart portrait system makes it easy to take flattering portraits of family and friends. It activates features like Face-priority AF, which automatically detects your subjectâs facial area and focuses on it. Even if your subject moves or you change the composition of your photo, it will automatically retain focus on their face. Smile mode releases the shutter when it detects your subject smiling, while Blink warning lets you know immediately if your subject blinked while your photo was taken, so you can retake the shot. Underwater face framing saves you from having to get wet when shooting poolside or at the beach, by taking underwater shots automatically when it detects peopleâs faces.


Sharp focus
Target finding AF incorporated (in Auto mode) gives you sharp focus in every image. It accurately predicts the main subject in your shot, so just by framing your image youâll achieve focus automatically. The focus area is shown on the monitor before you press the shutter, so you know exactly where the main focus of your image will be. For human subjects, faces are the priority for focus.

5-axis Image Stabilisation eliminates the blur caused by camera-shake in virtually any shooting situation â from shift movements with macros to angular shake with telephoto lenses, or rolling at night. 5-axis IS works irrespective of the lens attached and compensates admirably for up to four steps of shutter speed. Even movies recorded one-handed come out blur-free.

The all-weather Nikon Coolpix W300 is an easy-to-use camera compact camera that's perfect for the great outdoors. The W300 is waterproof down to an incredible 30 metres without housing...it's also shockproof, freeze-proof, and dustproof. The back-illuminated CMOS sensor and bright f/2.8 lens combine to produce great images and you can record your videos in stunning 4K or Full HD. You Geotag your shots and log your journey with the built-in GPS.


Waterproof to 30m, shockproof, freeze-proof, and dustproof
Capture photos and video at depths of up to 30m without housing. A solid performer on land too, this dustproof compact lets you shoot in temperatures as low as -10Â° C. And the shockproof body can tolerate drops from heights of up to 2.4m.


16 megapixel CMOS sensor
The sensitive back-illuminated CMOS sensor and bright f/2.8 lens give you the freedom to shoot underwater or in low light. The 5x optical zoom offers a flexible range of 24â120mm (35mm equivalent). And the 10x Dynamic Fine Zoom effectively doubles your reach to 240 mm (35mm equivalent).â´ Macro mode lets you capture extreme close-ups of tiny wonders above or below the water.


4K/UHD video
Easily shoot stunning 4K/UHD 30p footage, or record Full HD (1080p) video on land or underwater. An AE lock helps capture smooth footage as the light changes, which is especially handy when filming underwater. You can save frames as photos when viewing footage in playback mode, and optimise video for sharing on social networks by recording in MP4 format. A wind-noise-reduction function can reduce the sound that is produced when wind passes over the cameraâs built-in stereo microphone.


Superlapse movie
Capture a fast-forward dash along a new trail with Superlapse movie. This clever function enables a central subject to be placed in quickly changing scenes and settings. Let the camera create a time-lapse movie clip of the night sky or the sun setting over the horizon.


Stay connected via SnapBridge
Nikonâs SnapBridge lets you keep the COOLPIX W300 constantly connected to your smart device via Bluetooth low energy technology. Sync photos to your device as you shoot, without having to reconnect each time. Transfer movies manually whenever you want via the cameraâs built-in Wi-Fi. SnapBridge connectivity also lets you use your smart device to shoot remotely.


Fast autofocus
The fast autofocus (AF) system with Target Finding AF technology keeps the focus on your intended subject, even underwater or in low light. Subjects snap into focus incredibly quickly, whether youâre taking an underwater portrait of your diving buddy or filming action as the daylight fades. Nikonâs five-axis Hybrid Vibration Reduction compensates for camera shake so you get steady video footage.


Ergonomic design, large LCD
Weighing in at just 231 g, this small camera still packs a large monitor with great visibility. The 3-inch 920k-dot TFT monitor makes it simple to confirm camera settings, check compositions, or review images. You can use the LED light button to illuminate darker surroundings. Extra space between the buttons plus a large zoom control facilitate easier operation when wearing gloves. And the deep, non-slip grip ensures a firm hold.

Itâs cold-resistant down to -10Â°C and dustproof too, letting you carry it with you anywhere without a care. You can just relax and enjoy making photography fun for everyone.


High quality images
Say goodbye to grainy shots and missed moments when you can shoot with a crystal clear NIKKOR lens and a 13.2 MP CMOS image sensor. The NIKKOR 3x optical zoom is extendable to 6x Dynamic Fine Zoom, bringing you closer to your subject so you can shoot all the fun and capture great facial expressions too. High image quality is guaranteed, helping you to shoot images and video that youâll be proud to share.


Easy sharing with Snapbridge
Your high-quality Nikon images can light up your social networks in seconds with SnapBridge. It uses BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (BLE) to maintain a constant, low-power connection between your camera and up to five smart devices. Photos can be automatically transferred to your phone or tablet as you shoot. Simply pick up your smart device and your photos will be there: images synced while you shoot are automatically re-sized so theyâre easy to review, or edit in your favourite app, and quick to upload to social media. If you donât want to automatically sync every photo, simple controls let you manually sync specific photos, transfer images at larger resolutions, and sync movies.


Full HD Video
Make great movies with friends and family at the touch of a button. Just press the dedicated video record button and youâll be shooting Full HD 1080p video with stereo sound. When the action starts youâll always be ready to record memorable moments in motion, while Electronic VR (Vibration Reduction) keeps your movies smooth. You can even play around with a Diorama effect to make your movies look like miniature scenes, and play back on your HDTV with an optional HDMI cable. Bring special celebrations and travel scenes to life in high-quality movies that are perfect for social sharing.


Easy and intuitive operation
When the actionâs happening, the last thing you want to worry about is how to operate your camera, so the COOLPIX W100 makes it easy for you. Four dedicated buttons allow direct access to the menu, while a simple-to-use interface helps you find the feature you need with ease. Buttons are large and friendly to small hands, designed to make shooting comfortable for photographers of all ages. Select Easy auto mode and your camera will optimise all its settings for you, giving you great images every time. The large 230k-dot 6.7cm/2.7in TFT LCD monitor makes framing shots easy, and its anti-reflection coating and brightness adjustment means youâll always have clear visibility â even in low light or direct sunlight. Micro-USB charging gives you a quick recharge time, so youâre always ready to capture that perfect moment.


Family friendly features
The COOLPIX W100 makes shooting simple for even the smallest of photographers with a Variety menu that gives you a choice of adult or child menus. Inside the childrenâs menu, brightly coloured Welcome screens change from day to night, according to the time of shooting. Welcome characters also appear to make shooting even more fun, and children can play with adding cartoon effects or cute stamps like hearts and stars to their images too. Your camera comes in a range of vibrant colours to suit any lifestyle.


Creative effects
Make your photos stand out with a range of effects from Highlight colors âadding a pop of colour to a black and white image â to Fisheye and Toy camera. Glamour retouch lets you give everyone a makeover with options like Mascara, Whiten teeth or Lipstick. You can even add light trails to your photos with Multiple exposure lighten or create a Slide show with sound right in your camera. Never have a dull photo day again!


Perfect portraits
Smart portrait system makes it easy to take flattering portraits of family and friends. It activates features like Face-priority AF, which automatically detects your subjectâs facial area and focuses on it. Even if your subject moves or you change the composition of your photo, it will automatically retain focus on their face. Smile mode releases the shutter when it detects your subject smiling, while Blink warning lets you know immediately if your subject blinked while your photo was taken, so you can retake the shot. Underwater face framing saves you from having to get wet when shooting poolside or at the beach, by taking underwater shots automatically when it detects peopleâs faces.


Sharp focus
Target finding AF incorporated (in Auto mode) gives you sharp focus in every image. It accurately predicts the main subject in your shot, so just by framing your image youâll achieve focus automatically. The focus area is shown on the monitor before you press the shutter, so you know exactly where the main focus of your image will be. For human subjects, faces are the priority for focus.

The Nikon KeyMission 80 is tough, quick, and always ready to go. This wearable action cam has a rapid start-up time and hands-free operation make it ideal for rough terrain. The waterproof/shockproof body contains two Nikon cameras that both feature a wide-angle NIKKOR lens. The main camera shoots fast and delivers vivid, high-contrast images despite its compact size. Both cameras shoot Full HD video, and you can share images instantly via Nikonâs SnapBridge.


High quality photos and Full HD video
From bright, exposed mountain trail to the shadowy depths of the jungle, the KeyMission 80 lets you capture nature in all its glory with vivid, high-contrast images and video. Waterproof down to 1m and shockproof from heights of up to 1.5m, this tough, wearable action camera delivers superior image quality in all weather conditions. Its compact body contains two Nikon cameras: the main 12.4 MP camera features a 4.5 mm NIKKOR wide-angle lens, which offers an 80-degree angle of view. Exclusively designed for the camera, this super-small lens enables high-resolution images filled with rich texture and detail: itâs ideal for capturing vistas and dramatic Full HD movies. The secondary 4.9 MP self-portrait camera is located on the back of the body. This camera boasts a 1.8mm NIKKOR wide-angle lens, which offers a 90-degree angle of view: ideal when you want to take centre stage with the whole landscape spread out around you. 


Rapid-fire start-up and shooting 
Thanks to its specialised autofocus / vibration reduction mechanism, the quick KeyMission 80 makes it easy to capture instances of fleeting beauty. If you use the supplied Camera Holder AA-4 to attach the camera to your backpack, simply detach the camera from the holder to switch the power on. Shoot via the cameraâs touchscreen or shutter release button. Reattach the KeyMission 80 to the camera holder, and it will switch off again automatically. If youâre not using the camera holder, you can press any button and the camera will be ready to shoot in well under a second. Whichever method you use, through-the-lens image display activates instantly, and the camera is ready to record movies or capture images right after power on. And with incredibly short shooting intervals, the KeyMission 80 wonât miss a shot.


Never in the way
Small, light, and with multiple ways to wear and carry it, the KeyMission 80 is a natural choice in places where youâd hesitate to take out your compact camera or smartphone. A built-in strap and karabiner eyelet make it simple to hang the camera around your neck, or attach it to your belt. The supplied Camera Holder AA-4 securely fastens the camera to the strap of a backpackâjust clip it on and youâre ready for action. The on-board LED light aids focusing in dark situations, and a micro SD card slot keeps the camera light without compromising on storage. To make sure you get great quality images and video on the move, Nikonâs electronic Vibration Reduction (e-VR) dramatically reduces the effects of camera shake. And a wind noise reduction function lets you reduce the sound of wind passing over the cameraâs built-in stereo microphone during movie recording. 


Record hands free: handy, easy to operate design
Record every moment without interrupting the experience. Everything about the KeyMission 80 has been designed with the outdoor adventurer in mind. Thereâs no need to stop what youâre doing to dig out your camera and frame the shot. The KeyMission 80 is right there and ready to go, with simple controls that let you take high-resolution photos and record Full HD movie footage. You can operate the camera with your thumb while you hold the body: or you can shoot completely hands free, with the camera attached to the supplied Camera Holder AA-4. Easy-to-read, high-contrast icons are arranged on the cameraâs 1.7 in, 230 k-dot touch-panel LCD monitor so they never overlap with the image. The screen is treated with an anti-reflective coating for high visibility even in bright sunlight. 


Creative shooting modes
Versatile still image and movie shooting modes make it easy to do justice to stunning scenery and exciting events. Capture the beauty of mountain vistas with Easy Panorama. Fill in highly contrasting scene elements using High Dynamic Range (HDR). Create a time-lapse movie of the climb to the summit. You can even attach the camera to the forks of your bike, activate the route-shooting feature, then forget about it. Youâre free to focus on the ride, while the camera captures breathtaking action shots. Route-shooting records up to 100 still images, or a series of 10 three-second movie logs, at preset intervals during a specified shooting time. The camera can even edit the resulting footage for youâautomatically combining your short clips into an adventurous 30-second highlight reel.


SnapBridge: keep your Nikon connected to your smart device
The KeyMission 80 is BluetoothÂ®3 enabled, and fully compatible with Nikonâs SnapBridge. Utilising BluetoothÂ®3 low energy technology, SnapBridge maintains a constant, low-power connection between your camera and your favourite smartphone or tablet. Connecting the camera to your smart device is an easy, one-time operation. Once itâs done, photos can be transferred automatically from the camera to your device as you shoot: you can share your adventures the moment you stop for the day. Images synced while you shoot are automatically re-sized so theyâre easy to review and quick to upload to social media. Review, edit in your favourite app, or upload to your social feeds while dinner cooks on the campfire. Every time you land in a new location, SnapBridge will automatically update your camera with the right time and date. All your shots will be in the correct date order no matter how many time zones you cross. And SnapBridge even makes it simple to geotag images so itâs easy to plot photos on a map.

The Olympus TG-Tracker is a super-rugged action camera for capturing high-quality stills and 4K video with full tracking data in extreme shooting situations.The TG Tracker has a detachable grip, ultra-wide angle lens, 5-axis image stabilisation and a flip-out LCD monitor â so you can easily frame and shoot blur-free, by hand, in harsh conditions.


Go anywhere, record everything
The Olympus TG-Tracker is ready to record in the harshest environments without added protection. It is waterproof down to 30 metres, shockproof to a height of 2.1 metres, crushproof to a weight of 100kg, dustproof and freezeproof down to -10Â°C.

Unlike products with regular geotagging, the TG-Tracker can sense acceleration, altitude or depth and temperature as well as direction of movement â in addition to latitude and longitude. This gives extreme sports enthusiasts a much fuller picture of where they were, what was happening and how they were performing at the moment any given image was captured. 


High-end image quality
The TG-Tracker includes a 5-axis image stabilisation for video with flip-out colour LCD for framing and reviewing the action. Its ultra-wide lens captures an incredible 204Â° field of view. The TG-Tracker records 4K video powered by the same TruePic VII image processor found in several high-end Olympus interchangeable-lens cameras. 


Underwater, the camera automatically adjusts white balance and other settings, and there is an up to 60 lumen spotlight for shooting when it would otherwise be too dark. The supplied grip extension and built-in mirror mean owners can hold their camera how they want and they make it as easy to shoot selfies or, using a compatible mount or harness, completely hands-free. Alternatively, you can operate the camera remotely from a phone with OI.Share installed, another of Olympusâ free Apps.


Olympus Image Track software supplied
Reviewing footage is when the TG-Tracker really comes into its own â and the images and data recorded come vividly to life, either as high-resolution 4K video on a full-size TV or on a smartphone equipped with the new version of the free Olympus OI.Track App. Transferring stills and video to the phone is simple, via Wi-Fi. OI.Track offers owners a variety of features and settings, but the most important is the option to browse images and related log data together, in split-screen mode. The log for each clip or still can be viewed from two perspectives: as a birds-eye map or as a chart plotting depth/altitude against time. By comparing past logs stored in the App, itâs easy to calculate distance covered, speed and other variables.

The Nikon D850 is a 45.7 megapixel DSLR that gives full-frame photographers the ultimate combination of resolution, speed, and light sensitivity. An upgrade from the highly successful Nikon D810, The D850 is the first Nikon FX-format D-SLR camera to offer full-frame 4K UHD video, whilst time-lapse shooters can create high-resolution sequences under extremely low light with up to ISO 25600.





Nikon FX-format, backside illumination CMOS
sensor delivering 45.7 megapixels with ISO 64-25600
The D850 allows landscape photographers to capture a diverse range of scenes in sumptuously rich detail. It is the first Nikon D-SLR to use a backside illumination sensor, which allows incoming light to reach
photodiodes more efficiently. Together with the cameraâs low-noise performance, this enables it to achieve ISO 25600 despite its high pixel count. Whatâs more, it strikes an optimal balance between sensor sensitivity and the volume of light information accumulated in
photodiodes, yielding images with a wide dynamic range even at ISO 64 (expandable to ISO 32 equivalent) â the lowest native ISO setting offered by any camera manufacturer. Copper wiring is used to cut
electrical resistance, while the backside illumination structure allows a flexible wiring layout, reducing stray capacity. These measures enable 45-megapixel FX-format images to be captured at continuous
shooting speeds of 9 fps*1. And because the sensor is designed without an optical low-pass filter, it can harness the sharpness of 45 megapixels when combined with the high resolving power of NIKKOR lenses. The D850 yields pictures that can be enlarged as massive prints at up to A2 size or used for 8K digital signage displays.


EXPEED 5 powerful image processing
Thanks to its EXPEED 5 image-processing engine, EXPEED 5 processor renders delicate tonality in highly vivid colors, and its superb noise reduction suppresses noise effectively while maintaining detail. Its powerful calculation ability also permits high-speed continuous shooting at approx. 9 fps* with 45 megapixels, as well as full-frame, 4K UHD movie recording.


Picture Control system
Nikonâs Picture Control system helps you craft images that match your creative intentions and purposes. The D850 incorporates
the new Auto Picture Control, in addition to the seven existing presets. Each preset allows you to tune settings such as
sharpening and clarity, opening up a wider range of options for achieving your ideal image. You can adjust settings and store
them as your own custom Picture Controls.


Auto Picture Control
Auto Picture Control produces more desirable images by automatically fine-tuning the tone curve, color, sharpening and clarity of the Standard
option, according to each sceneâs characteristics. As a result, blue skies and verdant greens are rendered more vibrantly for landscape shots.
The Advanced Scene Recognition System is now even better at identifying light sources, meaning red colors can be emphasized in sunsets and
sunrises.


Silent photography at 45 megapixels
When capturing a night sky blanketed with stars, you probably want to avoid even the tiniest image blur to maximize the advantage of 45 megapixels. The D850âs silent photography function in live view mode utilizes an electronic shutter instead of triggering any mirror or shutter
movement, meaning it doesnât cause any mechanical vibration. Photographers can capture every last detail in 45 megapixels â and in complete
silence. This mode can be used in approx. 6-fps continuous shooting, but can also shoot approx. 8.6-megapixel pictures in DX image area at
approx. 30 fps.


New natural light auto white balance option
The D850 employs a new ânatural light autoâ white balance mode, taking advantage of
the Advanced Scene Recognition Systemâs improved light source identification function.
This option delivers optimal white balance results under natural light â a valuable asset
for landscape shooters. It makes it possible to respond quickly to changes in the weather
conditions without switching to the direct sunlight or cloudy options. When shooting scenes
such as an autumnal landscape awash with red leaves or spectacular orange sunset, it also
enhances the warm colors, helping create even more impressive pictures.


Convenient shooting with ND filters â Low-light metering down to -3 EV
The D850 employs a 180K-pixel RGB sensor with superb low-light sensitivity, the same as the flagship D5, offering
metering down to -3 EV*2. This helps enormously when shooting low-light scenes. It is also invaluable when
capturing long-exposure shots with ND filters (such as seascapes or running water), as it allows you to rely fully
on the cameraâs AE and AF without needing to detach the filter. Furthermore, the Advanced Scene Recognition
System uses the RGB sensorâs increased pixel count to enhance the accuracy of various auto controls such as
auto white balance, i-TTL balanced fill-flash, auto-area AF, 3D-tracking and Active D-Lighting, making it easier for photographers to achieve their desired results.


0.75Ã optical viewfinder
The D850 provides a wide field of view for easier subject confirmation with a 0.75Ã
magnification* for its optical viewfinder â the highest ever offered by a Nikon FXformat
D-SLR. The viewfinder has been redesigned to employ an aspherical lens and a
new condenser lens with refined refraction, allowing for a slimmer body while keeping
a sufficiently long eye point. Its high-contrast viewfinder information display uses
organic EL display elements, making it easier to read even under bright sunlight.

153-point AF system
The D850âs powerful 153-point AF system â the same acclaimed technology used in the

The Panasonic Lumix GX9 is a sleek and stylish  Mirrorless Camera boasting a host of great features - perfect for amateur photographers wanting a professional experience. The GX9 features a 20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor without a low-pass filter, 5-axis Dual Image Stabilisation to keep your images blur-free, a new  3-inch, 1240K-dot high resolution touch monitor, 4K video shooting and 4K Photo mode, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity and a new Monochrome filter.


20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor
The 20.3 megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor comes without a low-pass filter to ensure the greatest details are captured and an optimised gradation setting provides a wide dynamic range. Three-dimensional Colour Control detects hue, saturation levels and brightness individually and achieves the truest colour reproduction from dark to bright parts of the image - especially improving skies or human skin. 


Image Stabilisation
For greater precision, the Lumix GX9 incorporates 5-axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabiliser) for more effective suppression of blur. Combining an O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabiliser, 2-axis) and a B.I.S. (Body Image Stabiliser, 5-axis), the 5-axis Dual I.S. compensates for a larger range of movement, making it possible to use 4-stop slower shutter speed. Users can enjoy blur-free photo/video shooting from wide to tele, even in low-light situations. 


The 5-axis Dual I.S. works in both photo and motion picture recording including 4K video. Panasonic Lumix G Cameras offer a wide variety of digital interchangeable lenses and most of them comply with this 5-axis dual I.S. 


Silent Mode
To further reduce motion blur, the Lumix GX9âs shutter unit incorporates an electromagnetic drive which reduces the risk of shutter shock by approximately 90%. For street photographers who need to minimise disrupting their subjects, the sound of the mechanical shutter is also reduced in volume. For further reduction in noise, Silent Mode switches the shutter from mechanical to electronic and turns all sound (AF, operation) off while suppressing the emission of the AF assist lamp and flash with just a single setting; perfect for special shooting occasions. 


Sophisticated 4K Capabilities 
With its high-speed signal readout and processing of the engine, the Lumix GX9 is capable of recording smooth, high-resolution 4K video in 3840x2160 at 30p / 25p(50Hz Area) or 24p in MP4. With its high-speed signal readout and processing of the engine, the Lumix GX9 is capable of recording smooth, high-resolution 4K video in 3840x2160 at 30p / 25p(50Hz Area) or 24p in MP4.


Intuitive Creativity with new Filter 
For more intuitive control, an exposure dial has been included for quick change of exposure setting. A Focus lever has also been added to the back side of the camera enabling users to change between AFS (AFF), AFC and manual focus without diving into a menu.  


For further creative freedom, Focus and Aperture Bracketing have been added. With Focus Bracketing, a maximum of 999 images can be shot with different focal distances. Aperture Bracketing lets users have multiple shots with different depth of field. Users can later choose the shot with the best focus level or most fitting depth of field characteristic. 


Also new to the Lumix GX9 is the option to shoot photos with and without creative filter options applied simultaneously. RAWs can be developed in the camera, allowing independence from access to a computer. Sophisticated modes, such as Multi exposure and Time lapse shot/ stop motion animation are also available in the Lumix GX9.


Connectivity
The Lumix GX9 integrates Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity to offer a more flexible shooting experience and instant image sharing. Once the camera is connected to a smartphone or tablet installed with Panasonic's dedicated application software Panasonic Image App for iOS / Android, users can shoot, browse and share images remotely. Compatibility with Bluetooth  (called BLE: Bluetooth Low Energy) enables constant connection with a smartphone/tablet with minimum power consumption. This enables the camera to activate by simply using a smartphone/tablet or to add GPS geotag on the photos automatically.

You can take advantage of Focus Peaking, 5x magnified view and fine adjustment functions to set focus precisely, taking as much time as you want after shooting. 


Light Composition
The LUMIX TZ80 newly incorporates Light Composition function with which the camera synthesize the images by choosing and saving a brighter pixel. This makes it possible to produce more luxurious, dramatic image of situations such as fireworks or night scenery in camera with ease. The 4K Live Croping in video recording realizes stable panning or zooming in video recording. In panning shots, you can just set the viewing angle to start and end with to get smooth panning imagery without using a special equipment like a slider. In zooming, you can set the after-zoomed viewing angle first, so that the subject can be perfectly in the frame. Thanks to the digital operation, the imagery of zooming is smooth because it does not move zoom lens physically.


DFD (Depth From Defocus) technology
For even faster response and higher mobility, the LUMIX TZ80 newly integrates the DFD (Depth From Defocus) technology*2 to achieve ultra high-speed AF of approx. 0.1 sec. It contributes to the high speed burst shooting at 10 (AFS) / 5 (AFC) fps.

The Nikon D850 is a 45.7 megapixel DSLR that gives full-frame photographers the ultimate combination of resolution, speed, and light sensitivity. An upgrade from the highly successful Nikon D810, The D850 is the first Nikon FX-format D-SLR camera to offer full-frame 4K UHD video, whilst time-lapse shooters can create high-resolution sequences under extremely low light with up to ISO 25600.





Nikon FX-format, backside illumination CMOS
sensor delivering 45.7 megapixels with ISO 64-25600
The D850 allows landscape photographers to capture a diverse range of scenes in sumptuously rich detail. It is the first Nikon D-SLR to use a backside illumination sensor, which allows incoming light to reach
photodiodes more efficiently. Together with the cameraâs low-noise performance, this enables it to achieve ISO 25600 despite its high pixel count. Whatâs more, it strikes an optimal balance between sensor sensitivity and the volume of light information accumulated in
photodiodes, yielding images with a wide dynamic range even at ISO 64 (expandable to ISO 32 equivalent) â the lowest native ISO setting offered by any camera manufacturer. Copper wiring is used to cut
electrical resistance, while the backside illumination structure allows a flexible wiring layout, reducing stray capacity. These measures enable 45-megapixel FX-format images to be captured at continuous
shooting speeds of 9 fps*1. And because the sensor is designed without an optical low-pass filter, it can harness the sharpness of 45 megapixels when combined with the high resolving power of NIKKOR lenses. The D850 yields pictures that can be enlarged as massive prints at up to A2 size or used for 8K digital signage displays.


EXPEED 5 powerful image processing
Thanks to its EXPEED 5 image-processing engine, EXPEED 5 processor renders delicate tonality in highly vivid colors, and its superb noise reduction suppresses noise effectively while maintaining detail. Its powerful calculation ability also permits high-speed continuous shooting at approx. 9 fps* with 45 megapixels, as well as full-frame, 4K UHD movie recording.


Picture Control system
Nikonâs Picture Control system helps you craft images that match your creative intentions and purposes. The D850 incorporates
the new Auto Picture Control, in addition to the seven existing presets. Each preset allows you to tune settings such as
sharpening and clarity, opening up a wider range of options for achieving your ideal image. You can adjust settings and store
them as your own custom Picture Controls.


Auto Picture Control
Auto Picture Control produces more desirable images by automatically fine-tuning the tone curve, color, sharpening and clarity of the Standard
option, according to each sceneâs characteristics. As a result, blue skies and verdant greens are rendered more vibrantly for landscape shots.
The Advanced Scene Recognition System is now even better at identifying light sources, meaning red colors can be emphasized in sunsets and
sunrises.


Silent photography at 45 megapixels
When capturing a night sky blanketed with stars, you probably want to avoid even the tiniest image blur to maximize the advantage of 45 megapixels. The D850âs silent photography function in live view mode utilizes an electronic shutter instead of triggering any mirror or shutter
movement, meaning it doesnât cause any mechanical vibration. Photographers can capture every last detail in 45 megapixels â and in complete
silence. This mode can be used in approx. 6-fps continuous shooting, but can also shoot approx. 8.6-megapixel pictures in DX image area at
approx. 30 fps.


New natural light auto white balance option
The D850 employs a new ânatural light autoâ white balance mode, taking advantage of
the Advanced Scene Recognition Systemâs improved light source identification function.
This option delivers optimal white balance results under natural light â a valuable asset
for landscape shooters. It makes it possible to respond quickly to changes in the weather
conditions without switching to the direct sunlight or cloudy options. When shooting scenes
such as an autumnal landscape awash with red leaves or spectacular orange sunset, it also
enhances the warm colors, helping create even more impressive pictures.


Convenient shooting with ND filters â Low-light metering down to -3 EV
The D850 employs a 180K-pixel RGB sensor with superb low-light sensitivity, the same as the flagship D5, offering
metering down to -3 EV*2. This helps enormously when shooting low-light scenes. It is also invaluable when
capturing long-exposure shots with ND filters (such as seascapes or running water), as it allows you to rely fully
on the cameraâs AE and AF without needing to detach the filter. Furthermore, the Advanced Scene Recognition
System uses the RGB sensorâs increased pixel count to enhance the accuracy of various auto controls such as
auto white balance, i-TTL balanced fill-flash, auto-area AF, 3D-tracking and Active D-Lighting, making it easier for photographers to achieve their desired results.


0.75Ã optical viewfinder
The D850 provides a wide field of view for easier subject confirmation with a 0.75Ã
magnification* for its optical viewfinder â the highest ever offered by a Nikon FXformat
D-SLR. The viewfinder has been redesigned to employ an aspherical lens and a
new condenser lens with refined refraction, allowing for a slimmer body while keeping
a sufficiently long eye point. Its high-contrast viewfinder information display uses
organic EL display elements, making it easier to read even under bright sunlight.

153-point AF system
The D850âs powerful 153-point AF system â the same acclaimed technology used in the
flagship D5 â delivers over 130% of the D810âs frame coverage, with 99 cross sensors
offering powerful detection. Thanks to a Multi-CAM 20K autofocus sensor module,
developed to keep noise to an absolute minimum, the central point functions at -4 EV* and
other focus points at -3 EV*. Accurate AF is possible in challenging low-light or low-contrast
situations â a great asset for landscape photographers shooting in the hours when light is
scarce, such as at sunrise and sunset, and especially useful for capturing nighttime scenes.

Paired with the Panasonic 14-42mm Power O.I.S. lens, the G7 utilises Dual IS and its large ISO sensitivity (max ISO 25,600). This combination makes it a good camera for shooting in all low-light conditions, as well as for keeping the camera steady while shooting with telephoto zoom lenses. Dual IS offers 2-axis (yaw and pitch) of stabilisation. 
The G7 uses a 9th generation Venus Engine, designed to produce high-quality images with natural colours and great detail. The camera is also capable of tackling fast-moving subjects, buffering full-resolution still images at an impressive 6fps (with AFC) or up to 10fps in electronic shutter mode. But it goes further with its 4K photo mode. Utilising its video functionality, the G7 allows you to select an 8-megapixel JPEG image from 4K video recorded at 30fps in-camera, meaning you should never miss the decisive moment when using the G7. Additionally, the G7 offers a range of shooting modes to support photographers in a range of challenging scenarios, including silent shooting, a maximum 1/8000 shutter speed and Star Light AF, which can focus in lighting conditions as dim as -4EV; equivalent to moonlight. The G7 features Panasonicâs advanced Depth From Defocus (DFD) autofocus system, enabling it to focus quickly and accurately in as little as 0.07 seconds. The same technology that DFD uses also allows photographers to enjoy Post Focus Simulation, a Lumix-exclusive feature that allows creators to change the focal point of an image after capturing it. 
The cameraâs free-angle 3.0-inch 1040k-dot LCD offers a sharp display for composing images, with touch control for tactile operation. It also offers a large tilting 2,360K-dot OLED electronic viewfinder, ideal for composing images in bright sunlight. 
For enthusiast photographers looking for DSLR quality and ergonomic handling in a small system camera, the Panasonic G7 is a comprehensive camera package in a tough, portable body that offers full manual control and some revolutionary features. 
Panasonic G7 - Video recording and connectivity
The G7 can deliver professional-quality video up to QFHD 4K (3840x2160) 25p/24p (PAL) video internally, as well as Full HD video at 50p (PAL). Sharing much of its DNA with the comprehensive Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH4, this camera benefits from video-centric features such as Focus Peaking and the Cinelike D/Cinelike V professional video shooting profiles. 
Panasonic Lumix G7 owners can also connect their cameras to Android and Apple iOS smart devices using Wi-Fi and NFC, for seamless photo sharing and wireless camera control. 
Bundled with Panasonic Lumix 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH lens
The Panasonic 14-42mm pancake lens offers an equivalent focal range of 28-84mm in 35mm terms, which makes it suitable for a broad range of subjects, from landscapes to street photography and portraits, for example. Weighing only 95g, the 14-42 combined with the Panasonic G7 makes for an inconspicuous setup that is comfortable to carry on long trips. This lens uses a stepping motor to deliver fast, smooth autofocus for stills and video. Using enhanced power optical image stabilisation to compensate for camera shake, this lens will help photographers capture sharper images when taking pictures handheld.

Aimed at professional video creators, the Panansonic Lumix GH5S is the successor to Panasonic's best selling GH5 and it reaches incredible new heights in low-light recording. The GH5S combines a newly developed 10.2 megapixel high sensitivity sensor with Dual Native ISO technology and the latest Venus Engine to produce amazing results with suppressed noise in extremely low-lit situations. The Lumix GH5S extends your creative video shooting by including for the first time 4.096 x 2,160 Cinema 4K 60p/50p video recording, with no limit to the recording time. The GH5S has a large OLED Live View Finder with high magnification providng a smooth display at 120fps, along with a 1,620k-dot high-res 3.2-inch vari-angle touchscreen.   





10.2 Megapixel high-sensitivity.
Duel Native ISO Technology
The LUMIX GH5S achieves the highest-ever sensitivity and best image quality in LUMIX history. This is realised by combining the newly developed high sensitivity sensor with Dual Native ISO technology and the latest Venus Engine. Dual Native ISO is a revolutionary technology featured on Panasonicâs professional video cameras and offers the advantages of very high sensitivity while keeping noise levels low. Usually, with a conventional single native ISO, noise levels rise when sensitivity is increased. However, the newly developed image sensor implements dual circuits able to switch to high native 
sensitivity before gain processing. This means you can achieve beautiful footage with suppressed noise in low-lit situations.


Cinema 4K 60p/50p with Unlimited Recording Time
The original LUMIX GH5 made it possible to record 4K 60p/50p video on a DLSM camera. Now, to greatly extend your creative possibilities, the LUMIX GH5S takes this even further and, for the first time ever, includes Cinema 4K (C4K: 4096 x 2160) 60p/50p video recording . 
Moreover, there is no limit to the recording time, not even when shooting FHD or 4K video. 


Multiple Aspect Ratios
The LUMIX GH5S sensor handles multiple aspect ratios; 4:3, 17:9, 16:9 and 3:2. Thanks to broad margins of effective pixels, focal length does not change in these aspect ratios. Available for still photography, 4K and C4K video, and in Anamorphic mode, this function allows you to fully leverage the angle of view of the lens for truly stunning image expression. Also, even while using a larger sensor, high readout speeds are achieved. Rolling shutter distortion, compared to the LUMIX GH5, is suppressed by approximately 1.3x with high readout speeds when recording video or using an electronic shutter.


Max. 10x slow motion video - Variable Frame Rate
A variety of effects are available on the GH5S. The Variable Frame Rate lets you record overcranked/undercranked videos in C4K/4K )60fps maximum 2.5x slower) or FHD (240fps maximum 10x slower) quality. The minimum frame rate for quick-motion effects video is 2fps.


10-bit Internal Recording
The LUMIX GH5S brings game changing internal 4:2:2 10-bit C4K/4K video recording. For example, 10-bit will render all the subtleties of graduated skies and sunsets without the banding so prone to 8-bit. 
The power of having film creation capabilities inside the camera sets a new precedent in guerilla style film making. And you can record 4:2:2 10-bit to SD card whilst simultaneously feeding the live signal through a full-size HDMI port connected to an external monitor or recorder. 4:2:2 10-bit recording enables faithful colour and grading fidelity with over a billion colours and four times the tonality of 8-bit to match professional intent. 


10-bit HDMI Live Output and Simultaneous Internal Recording
The LUMIX GH5S is capable of 4:2:2 10-bit real-time image output to an external monitor or recorder via an optional HDMI cable (full size TypeA), while simultaneously providing an internal 
4:2:2 10-bit recording. It is suitable for professional video making that requires accurate monitoring of the imagery or high quality recording to external codec devices (such as ProRes).
A cable lock holder for the HDMI cable is bundled with the LUMIX GH5S to prevent unplugging problems on location. 


TC IN/OUT Terminal
The time code can be synchronized with an external device by using the bundled BNC conversion cable. This enables easier non-linear timeline editing of footage shot with multiple cameras.


LINE Input Supported
LINE input is supported by a 3.5mm mic jack. This makes it possible to input sounds from an external audio device, for more efficient video production.


Body Design
The GH5S is made from magnesium alloy with die-cast front and rear frames. It is splashproof, dust-proof as well as freezeproof to 14Â°F.


Built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth
Built-in Wi-Fi connectivity with NFC and Bluetooth allows for wireless image sharing and remote camera control from smartphones and tablets. Bluetooth LE also enables a constant connection to your mobile device, allowing for functions such as geo location and automatic image transfer.

The 24 megapixel Sony a6300 is the successor to the to the best selling a6000, and itâs a proper update: Sony has gone to town on reworking the speed, imaging and processing power hidden within this compact body.
The a6300 can focus in just 0.05 seconds â a new autofocus world record for a mirrorless camera with an APS-C sensor.


One of the standout features is called 4D Focus. The Sony a600 had 179 points of focus: the new a6300 has an astonishing 425 phase-detection focus points, distributed evenly across the whole of the cameraâs APS-C Exmor CMOS copper-wired sensor. So even if your subject ends up close to the edge of your frame, 
youâll still be able to lock onto your target. With a top speed of 11fps means youâre unlikely to miss a moment â and Sonyâs High Density Tracking feature 
claims that the AF will intelligently respond to the movement of a subject by readying the focus points nearest your target as it moves across your frame.
You can also shoot up to 8fps while youâre using Live View on the cameraâs rear screen.


if youâre more into video, thereâs plenty here to keep you occupied: 4K capture with Super 35mm format, a dedicated microphone line-in, plus Full HD at 120 fps at 100 Mbps â which is another first for Sonyâs cameras 
with APS-C sized sensors. Low-light video quality also promises to be impressive â and all that AF technology also applies to movie capture. 




0.05 sec AF speed 
The A6300 achieves the world's fastest (0.05 sec.) AF speed with the enhanced Fast Hybrid AFâs integrated autofocusing performance and the uncanny efficiency of the BIONZ X image processing engine to handle so much information with astonishing accuracy. 
 425 AF points 
With the worldâs most (425 points) focal plane phase-detection AF points helping to provide distinctively wide and dense AF point coverage, the Î±6300 focuses more accurately, efficiently and reliably on subjects throughout the frame.
 High-density Tracking AF Technology 
For supremely reliable accuracy and tracking stability, new High-density Tracking AF Technology activates AF points to cover the area around the subject with approx. 7.5 times as much density as the 6000. Only this focal plane phase-detection autofocus function can seamlessly activate AF points and track subjects moving within frame with such unerring precision.
High-speed live-view continuous shooting
Clearly capture action with high-speed continuous shooting at up to 11fps. Or choose among three speeds up to 8fps, according to the shooting situation, for live-view continuous shooting with very little lag on the EVF or LCD screen, to get the sense of immediacy of shooting with an optical viewfinder.
Superb image quality
The new 24.2 MP Exmor CMOS sensor raises the bar of imaging performance. Its copper wiring and enhanced circuitry make it possible to lower the wiring layer and boost light collection efficiency, in order to capture low-noise images with a wide sensitivity range up to ISO 51200. The use of copper raises readout speed as well as the potential of advanced 4K and Full HD 120fps shooting. 
The BIONZ X image processor works with the image sensor to provide stills and movies with more clarity and detailed texture, with less noise, especially in the mid-to-high ISO range.
4K movie recording
4K movie recording in the Super 35mm format with full pixel readout and no pixel binning allows approx. 2.4 times as much information as is basically required for 4K (QFHD: 3840 x 2160). Data this rich is, in fact, equivalent to 6K data, so it clearly conveys the ultimate resolution in 4K images.
S-Gamut/S-Log shooting
Newly employed S-Gamut/S-Log enable wide dynamic range (max. 1300%) shooting for more expressive movie-making in post-production. The Î±6300 even offers 14-stop latitude at S-Log3 setting.
 Full HD 120fps recording and Slow motion recording
You can shoot high-quality Full HD footage, even in Full HD 120fps (100fps) high-speed shooting with AF tracking at a high bit rate up to 100Mbps. Otherwise, the camera can record 4x/5x slow motion movies internally when the frame rate is set at 30p (25p) or 24p.
XGA OLED Tru-Finder
The Î±6300 introduces a high-contrast, high-resolution, high-visibility XGA OLED Tru-Finder that reproduces darkness and colour in very fine detail, as well as a mode to display images at the higher frame rate of 120fps (100fps), so you can see action smoothly and track it easily on this electronic viewfinder.
Wi-Fi/NFC /QR code functions improve connectivity with mobile devices
Wireless links via Near Field Communication (and now, via QR code, for those without NFC-enabled smartphones) make it easy to transfer image data from the Î±6300 to mobile devices.

The high megapixel count of the cameraâs CMOS image sensor allows in more light for finer detail capture in your images, while the ultra-responsive high-speed AF locks onto your subject rapidly, so youâll never miss a decisive moment. Target finding AF allows for more flexible composition, as the optimal focus area size and position are chosen according to the subject. When you aim your camera at your subject, it instantly predicts the area where focus should be acquired. The active focus area is automatically set in relation to the size of the subject, ensuring all images will be in clear focus. Target finding AF is as effective with subjects in the centre of frame as those that are off-centre, and works as well for smaller subjects like flowers and food as it does for human subjects.


4K UHD/30P movies with stereo sound 
Shoot impressively smooth movies in 4K Ultra High Definition (3840x2160/30p) â ensuring that your recordings are state-of-the-art and future-proof as 4K UHD becomes standard â with great sound quality from the zoom microphone, which adjusts directivity along with zoom operation.

Switch shooting styles seamlessly from screen to viewfinder, as the eye sensor automatically switches from monitor shooting when your eye gets close to the sensor. Viewfinder shooting is useful for cramped conditions and also ensures stable posture, minimising camera shake.


Vari-angle LCD monitor
The large vari-angle screen gives huge flexibility for creating different viewpoints â shoot high over crowds at concerts, take a low angle for wildlife and nature images, or shoot at a completely unique angle for architectural or travel shots. Self-shooting is simple with the vari-angle monitor, making it easy to add your personal commentary to the movies youâre shooting or snap a quick selfie when youâre in an unusual location. RGBW alignment provides superior visibility even in direct sunlight and offers low power consumption.


5-stop dual detect optical VR
Vibration reduction reduces camera shake so youâll always get sharp images with optimal exposure, regardless of your shooting conditions. The 5-stop Dual Detect Optical VRÂ² gives a compensation effect equivalent to a shutter speed 5 stops faster. This can eliminate the need for faster shutter speeds, preventing issues like improper exposure or over-increased sensitivity. By utilising the camera shake information detected by the angular velocity sensor together with the data on direction and amount of camera shake (motion vector information), the newly-developed VR algorithm enables a more accurate calculation of the amount of image blur to achieve a greatly enhanced vibration reduction performance.


Snapbridge
SnapBridge maintains a constant, low-power connection between your camera and your smartphone or tablet to give you easy control over your photographic life. Now you can sync shots to your smart device while you shoot, and share Nikon-quality images in an instant.

Youâll never miss a crucial moment again.


Shhot RAW images
Shooting RAW in Nikonâs NRW format means you never have to worry about any degradation in image quality. When images are written to the memory card in NRW format, the exposure compensation, white balance, hue, tone and sharpening information are saved as instruction sets within the file.

Trusted NIKKOR optics offer exceptional performance, so you can enjoy a powerful lens that covers from wide-angle 22.5 mm to through to super-telephoto 900 mm angles of view (equivalent focal lengths in 35 mm) in a compact camera.


Vibration Reduction
Camera stability is the key to achieving clear images. High-performance VR effectively suppresses the blur caused by camera shake, even at full 40x zoom, so sharp shots are guaranteed. The Lens shift VR effect is equivalent to a 3.0 stop increase in shutter speed (based on CIPA Standard, at the maximum telephoto position) and the easy-hold grip helps to keep your camera stable too.


Snapbridge
SnapBridge maintains a constant, low-power connection between your camera and your smartphone or tablet to give you easy control over your photographic life. Now you can sync shots to your smart device while you shoot, and share Nikon-quality images in an instant. You can also control key camera functions via your phone, keep your camera on time and up-to-date, and more.


Mode Dial

Impress your friends with crystal clear movies of family celebrations, concerts, architecture or wildlife, all shot in clear detail no matter how distant your subject â and save stills during movie recording.


3-inch 921K-dot tilting monitor
Enjoy ease of shooting with the wide viewing-angle tilting monitor, making creative composition simple and ensuring that you know exactly whatâs in frame. Shoot stills and movies in comfort from a wide range of angles, with flexibility for every type of subject. The high-definition display consumes very little power, so youâll have plenty of battery life to keep shooting when you need it most. It offers sharp colour reproduction and superb visibility even when viewed from a diagonal direction. Anti-reflection coating and anti-fingerprint acrylic coating ensure clear viewing at all times, and the 5-level brightness adjustment function gives superior visibility while playing back images on sunnier days.


Comfortable grip, portable size
Your camera is ergonomically designed for a stable grip, even though its body is extremely portable â approximately 113.5 (W) x 78.3 (H) x 94.9 (D) mm â and it fits comfortably in your hand. Itâs classically styled, with high performance and low weight too, weighing in at around 542 g, including batteries and SD card.


Target finding AF
Focus on your subject instantly with Target finding AF technology that analyses your shooting conditions to rapidly identify your subject. Just aim your camera at the intended subject and it will instantly predict where focus should be acquired. Active focus areas are set automatically in relation to the size of the subject, so your images will always be in clear focus. Target finding AF works as well with subjects found at the centre of frame as those off-centre, and is also effective in shooting smaller subjects like food and flowers.

The Fujifilm X-T2 is the successor to Fuji's previous flagship mirrorless camera, the X-T1. The rugged magnesium alloy body of the X-T2 is sealed against dust and moisture and has a unique articulating LCD as well as a large, high resolution EVF.

The XT2  offers outstanding image quality and upgrades with a 24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III sensor plus an APS-C sensor with no low-pass filter. The high-speed processing power and the use of improved algorithms have significantly improved the AF performance plus 4K high definition video is now supported on the X-T2.





Compact, lightweight & rugged design with tilting LCD
The X-T2âs compact and lightweight magnesium alloy body weighs just 507g (including memory card and battery) and is dust-resistant, water-resistant & capable of operating at temperatures as low as -10Â°C. 


Mechanical dials are provided for intuitive operation of all basic camera settings, including the shutter speed, ISO sensitivity, exposure compensation, drive modes and metering modes.	The settings can be instantaneously adjusted even when the camera is turned off, so that you can be always ready for the next shot.	The rear panel of the camera body features the Focus Lever. This can be moved up / down, right / left and diagonally to make quick changes to the focus area for accurate focusing.	The rear LCD screen is the X Seriesâ first three-direction tilting display, which tilts up and down when shooting in landscape, and upward when shooting in portrait. The screen remains positioned on the optical axis of the lens even when tilted, facilitating easy high-angle and low-angle shooting. When not tilted, it fits flush to the body to maintain its streamlined design.


Premium still image and video quality
The X-T2 features the 24.3MP X-Trans CMOS III, an APS-C sensor with no low-pass filter boasting the highest performance in the history of the X Series, as well as the X-Processor Pro high-speed image processing engine to deliver outstanding colour reproduction and gradation of tones in both stills and videos with high ISO sensitivity and low noise. The Film Simulation modes,  have further evolved to capture a subjectâs textures, three-dimensional feel.


The X-T2âs video function supports 4K video recording, which is the first in the X Series of cameras. Approx. 1.8 times the amount of information needed to produce a 4K video file (3840x2160) video is packed in to create stunning image quality.


Fast Autofocus & response
The high-speed processing power and the use of improved algorithms have significantly improved the basic autofocus performance, improving the focusing performance on points of light, low-contrast objects and subjects with fine and delicate textures such as bird feathers and animal fur.


The X-T2 also features AF-C Custom Settings for even higher accuracy in focus-tracking moving subjects. You can customize settings to optimize AF characteristics according to the type of subject movements.


4K video
The X-T2 supports high video bitrate recording of 100Mbps for both 4K and full HD video, enabling high-resolution footage with minimal compression artifacts.
The  Film  Simulation modes, popular for still images, can also be applied to video recording. The X-T2 supports Clean HDMI output for 4K video recording,
and also offers the âF-Logâ log-gamma option, which takes advantage of the sensorâs wide dynamic range to record video in wide colour gamut, facilitating video production workflow.


AF-C Custom Settings
AF-C algorithm has been significantly improved for even higher accuracy when focus-tracking moving subjects in the AF-C mode.	According to the type of movement, you can choose individual settings for âTracking Sensitivity,â âSpeed Tracking Sensitivityâ and âZone Area Switching,â or select one of five presets that combine specific settings for these three elements.


High resolution Electronic Viewfinder
The X-T2âs 2.36-million-dot high-resolution organic EL electronic viewfinder has the magnification ratio of 0.77x and maintains the display time lag of just 0.005 seconds. With the maximum brightness doubled from previous models, the viewfinder features the Automatic Brightness Adjustment function so that it is easy to see even in intense backlighting. It has improved resolution in the Live View  mode, and eliminates moirÃ© or false colours to enable focusing with greater accuracy.


The EVF refreshes at a rate of 60fps, or as high as 100fps in the Boost mode to deliver smooth display
of movements. It can continue displaying a moving subject without interruption. The fast rate of refresh is maintained even in low light for easy framing during night shooting. The X-T2âs blackout time is less than half of that of the X-T1 due to the parallel processing of Live. View display and fast shutter charging.	This has enabled continuous shooting of 5fps in  Live View, giving users the ability to easily continue tracking a moving subject.


Film Simulation function
The Film Simulation function now features the ACROS mode. Using X-Processor Proâs advanced processing capability, the mode offers smooth gradation, deep blacks and beautiful textures to create monochrome images that far outperform the previous Monochrome mode.


The X-T2 also has the Grain Effect function for reproducing distinctive graininess seen in photographs taken with film cameras. The function is available in âStrongâ and âWeak,â and can be combined with any of the Film Simulation modes. You can easily obtain the effect of film-based photos, notable especially when the image is printed out.


Improved ISO sensitivity
Improved ISO  sensitivity means ISO12800, which was part of extended ISOs in X-T1, is now available as a regular ISO option. Even at ultra-high ISO settings, the camera produces low-noise images, reproducing  deep blacks and smooth gradation of tones, capturing beautiful images even in low light conditions.


Wireless Communication function
Download the FUJIFILM Camera Remote app (free) onto your smartphone or tablet device and use the Wireless Communication function to transfer photos and videos to the device with easy one-touch operation, or browse photos and videos in the camera from the device to select and download specific images, without having to enter ID or password. The app also allows X-T2 to download location information from your device and attach it to images.


The appâs Remote Control function enables wireless operation of X-T2âs shutter, exposure, etc.
from your smartphone or tablet device. The Remote Control function allows you to not only handle basic operations such as Touch AF and Shutter Speed selection, but also adjust a diverse range of shooting settings or even record video remotely.

The Sony Î±99 II  is the flagship Sony A-mount camera featuring a full-frame 42.4-megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high-resolution image while providing high sensitivity, minimised noise, and wide dynamic range. Its wide standard ISO range 100-25600 is expandable to even wider ISO 50-102400.


See the NEW A99 Mark II... #Photokina pic.twitter.com/fjxzxgWI1a— Jessops (@jessops) September 20, 2016



42.4-megapixel back-illuminated full-frame CMOS sensor
Boasting its approx. 42.4 effective megapixel resolution, Î±99 II has a 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with back-illuminated structure, widely expanded sensitivity range, and extra-low noise performance. It also has no optical low-pass filter that can compromise sharpness, so fine clarity and detail extend from edge to edge of every frame.


High-speed BIONZ Xâ¢ image processing engine and front-end LSI
With detail reproduction technology to capture the essence of realism, diffraction-reducing technology to maintain clarity even at smaller apertures, and area-specific noise reduction to lower noise adaptively and reproduce greater detail, the BIONZ X image processing engine finely tunes the image sensor's effective 42.4-megapixel (approx.) data for truer, clearer depiction. Î±99 II is supported by a new front-end LSI to boost image data handling.


Brilliant AF and AE tracking even at 12fps
Track your subject regardless of how it moves. Revolutionary Hybrid Phase Detection AF System can capture even quick imminent movements â thanks to dense AF point coverage over a wide area and accelerated readout by the new image sensor for high-efficiency processing of vast amounts of phase-detection information. Through this sophisticated AF system â and faster shutter action due to a newly developed charge unit in the shutter mechanism â you can shoot up to 12fps14 continuously with steadfast AF and AE tracking13, allowing you to catch decisive moments in sharp detail at the proper focus and exposure.


Tough magnesium alloy body, dust & moisture resistant
Designed for solid reliability and steady handling, the camera body is built to withstand the rigors of shooting in the field. Its internal structure and top, front, and rear covers are all made of strong, rigid magnesium alloy.
Enjoy carefree shooting in tough environments, with comprehensive dust and moisture resistance23 measures that help prevent water and dust from entering the body. These measures include sealing around the buttons and dials, as well as media jack cover and enclosure edges featuring tongue-and-groove joints for double protection to tightly interlock panels and components.


8fps live-view continuous shooting
The camera achieves continuous shooting of up to 8fps15 for live-view shooting, using an improved display algorithm for OLED Tru-Finder and LCD monitor. Minimised display time lag lets you easily keep tracking a subject in motion.

The camera achieves continuous shooting of up to 8fps15 for live-view shooting, using an improved display algorithm for OLED Tru-Finder and LCD monitor. Minimised display time lag lets you easily keep tracking a subject in motion.


Flicker-free shooting
Flicker from fluorescent and other artificial lighting is automatically detected16 and the shutter is timed to minimise its effect on still images. This suppresses exposure and colour anomalies that can occur at the top and bottom of images shot at high shutter speeds, as well as exposure and colour inconsistency between continuous shots. You can take images under indoor lighting with confidence.


Hybrid Phase Detection AF System
Î±99 II has an AF sensor with 79-point phase-detection and an image sensor with the worldâs largest array of 399 focal-plane phase-detection AF points. Sonyâs original Translucent Mirror Technology allows light to reach the dedicated AF sensor and the image sensor simultaneously, so both phase-detection AF systems are always active. The AF algorithm has also been revised to support the Hybrid Phase Detection AF System. Its broad coverage and high density enable higher AF speed and precision as well as notably improved tracking performance.


79 Hybrid Cross points
Discover breakthrough autofocusing and tracking reliability. Sonyâs Hybrid Phase Detection AF System provides a dedicated AF sensor with phase-detection AF points (79 including 15 cross points) for horizontal detection. This AF point area is entirely covered by the 399-point focal-plane phase-detection AF sensor for vertical detection, so all 79 AF points can function as selectable Hybrid Cross points. By spreading points densely over an area and fine-tuning the balance between responsiveness and stability, Sony optimises subject tracking to stay locked on almost any type of subject without being affected by subject patterns. Moreover, the very central AF point also functions as an F2.8-sensitive sensor that supports lenses as bright as a minimum F-value of 2.8 or lower.


Precision AF effective down to EV-4 brightness
Low-light AF detection down to EV-4 (central focus point) has been achieved. The precision AF system will function properly even when shooting dimly lit scenes at high ISO. This opens dramatic new possibilities in low-light and night shooting.


Body-integrated 5-axis image stabilisation
This all-direction stabilisation system is fine-tuned for high-resolution image sensors to compensate accurately for five types of camera shake that can compromise handheld shooting of Î±99 II 42.4MP21 images. Designed for A-mount models, the body-integrated system offers extremely high performance in both stills and movies, whether you're shooting at longer focal lengths, in close-ups, or at night. Real-time effects can be monitored via live view. Camera shake compensation is equivalent to using a 4.5-step22 faster shutter speed, allowing you to take advantage of a wider range of shutter speeds.


4K movie recording
Thanks to full pixel readout without pixel binning, 4K movie recording in the Super 35mm format exhibits more detail-rich superior clarity than typical 4K movies since Super 35mm collects approximately 1.8 times as much information as needed for 4K movie output. Also, the XAVC S format27 allows 4K recording at maximum bitrate of 100Mbps to capture fine details of movement in movies.


14-bit RAW format
For RAW recording, 14-bit RAW output and 16-bit image processing help preserve maximum detail and produce images of the highest quality with rich tonal gradations. The 14-bit RAW (Sony ARW) format ensures optimal quality for later image adjustment (via Image Data Converter or other software). 1: Image Sensor 2: Newly developed high-speed front-end LSI 3: 16-bit image processing.


Location data acquisition via Bluetooth
Use Location Information Link to make the most of your camera anywhere you go together. After the camera has been paired to the PlayMemories Mobile app26 installed on a compatible mobile phone or tablet device, it can acquire location data from the mobile device and record that data with still images. The acquired location data can also be used to correct the cameraâs date/time and location settings. The PlayMemories Home application can then be utilised on a personal computer to organise still images imported into the computer on a map.

Exmor Râ¢ CMOS sensor for extra sensitivity
The more light is allowed to strike a sensor, the more brilliant a resulting image will look. So the Exmor R CMOS sensor with 18.2 effective megapixels employs back-illuminated design to let four times more light in than a more conventional sensor, is twice as sensitive to light, and even features Sony Column A/D Conversion technology to reduce image noise.


BIONZ Xâ¢ for more detail and less noise
To transform data from the Exmor R CMOS sensor into high-resolution images, the BIONZ X image processor integrates detail reproduction, diffraction-reducing and area-specific noise reduction technologies. This combination makes it possible to reproduce realistic images of truer colours and textures with exceptional precision in real time.


180-degree tiltable LCD monitor for easy framing
The high-resolution LCD on the camera back can be tilted up to 180 degrees. So when you're in front of the camera, you can easily view the LCD to check the framing before you shoot a selfie, for example. This flexibility also lets you comfortably maintain stress-free posture while monitoring a scene that you want to shoot from a low angle.


Fast Wi-Fi/NFCâ¢ connection simplifies sharing
You can use built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) to make a quick connection via Wi-Fi with Android mobile devices. Then, you can share favourite photos and movies within moments by sending them directly from the camera to the smartphones and tablets 2 of friends and family members. Downloading PlayMemories Mobile onto your mobile device enables you to control the camera remotely.


More flexible movie formats
The new XAVC S 3 format captures movies detailing extra-smooth action and high-quality sound with great fidelity to the original sources. Whether youâre shooting in XAVC S or high-definition AVCHD format, you can also simultaneously record another version of the same scene in a compressed, web-friendly MP4 format for convenient sharing.


Intelligent Active Mode keeps blur away
Have no fear of handheld movie shooting. Intelligent Active Mode, featuring Sony's advanced frame-analysis technology and 5-axis 4 image stabilisation, compensates for camera shake. This mode reduces the blurriness that tends to occur in images when shooting handheld or shooting while chasing a subject in action.


P/A/S/M exposure modes 
Put your creative intentions in motion with Programmed AE (P)/Aperture priority (A)/Shutter-speed priority (S)/Manual (M) exposure modes. These modes provide you with all the flexibility that you need to manually control exposure and adjust background blur in order to capture the image that you're looking for.


Customisable settings
Assign frequently used functions (Focus mode, White Balance, Picture Effect, etc.) to customisable buttons and keys for easier, quicker access to such functions while shooting. For example, you can assign 12 functions to the Function button, then press it, choose a function, and adjust function parameters via the control ring or rear control wheel.


Extra-speedy & precise Fast Intelligent AF
An improved spatial object detection algorithm realises a more optimal and accurate lens drive to make AF even faster, for capturing more fleeting moments with ease.


Beauty Effect improves appearance
Retouch the appearance of people in photos quickly and intuitively. With the five modes of Beauty Effect, you can smooth skin, tone skin, dull overly glistening skin, widen eyes and brighten teeth â all in camera, with no need for a PC. Your subjects will love how they can look almost magically enhanced in your portraits.


PlayMemories Camera Apps 
Enhance your creative expression with PlayMemories Camera Apps, offering a growing range of enjoyable applications that are easy to download. Not only do these apps give you greater functionality â they are the ultimate means of personalising your camera to fulfill your photographic aims.


Shoot for longer
Don't worry about depleting your camera battery while you're on the road. The fully charged lithium-ion battery of the WX500 provides enough power to shoot approx. 400 stills or record approx. 75 5 minutes of movie footage, so you won't miss out on a great photo opportunity.

The Pentax KP is a high-performance, high-resolution DSLR with a compact, slim, weatherproof body. It features a new-generation CMOS image sensor and a high-performance imaging engine to deliver high-resolution, rich-gradation images from its 24.32 effective megapixels. It also incorporates a five-axis shake-reduction system, which provides a compensation effect of five shutter steps.


Super high sensitivity, high resolution imaging
The PENTAX KP couples a new generation CMOS image sensor with the PRIME IV imaging engine and an accelerator unit. Together these expand the upper limit of the sensitivity range without generating annoying noise. With a top sensitivity of ISO 819200, it assures super high sensitivity photography to deliver high resolution, rich gradation images with faithful reproduction of the subjectâs texture and a sense of depth, even at higher ISO settings. It also produces high quality images across the entire sensitivity range.


Effective camera shake compensation
The PENTAX KP comes equipped with the innovative sensor shift SR II (Shake Reduction II), which ensures optimum compensation effect for all lenses. In addition to common camera shake caused by pitch and yaw, this five-axis mechanism also compensates for camera shake caused by horizontal and vertical shift (often generated in macro photography). Also camera shake caused by roll, which is difficult to handle by in-lens shake reduction systems. Thanks to a wide compensation range of five shutter steps, it benefits a number of handheld applications, such as when using a telephoto lens or shooting in poorly lit locations, to capture sharp, blur-free images.


New APS-C CMOS image sensor
The PENTAX KP incorporates a new-generation, APS-C CMOS image sensor with approximately 24.32 effective megapixels to produce high resolution images. It has been engineered to remove the optical AA (anti-aliasing) filter to optimise the image sensorâs outstanding imaging power. The result is sharp, fine detailed images with an accurate sense of depth. By processing image data at a high read-out speed of 14bit, it produces beautiful, rich gradation images.


Dustproof, weather-resistant construction
To prevent the intrusion of water and dust into the interior, the PENTAX KP features 67 sealing parts, applied to the control buttons and dials, covers and exterior joints. By mounting an AW- or WR-series lens* and the optional, weather-resistant D-BG7 battery grip, they form a highly airtight digital imaging system that assures dependable performance even under unfavorable weather conditions.

This clever technology gives pin-sharp results in virtually any shooting situation without using a tripod, even night scenes.


4K movies with image stabilisation
Sometimes the the detail in 4K movies can be lost to shakes and blur. Olympus has taken that worry away from photographers new to movie making, because the E-M10 Mark IIIâs high-performance image stabilisation is built into the camera body and compensates for camera shake with any lens in any scene, even hand held.

New features

AUTO mode (previously iAUTO) has been significantly improved for better blur-free images â detecting movement even in the dark.
Scene (SCN) mode has been upgraded and will help photographers to take control of the results they want by choosing one of six themes with predefined settings.
The Advanced Photo (AP) mode has been added so that photographers can fine tune their images and enjoy incredible shooting methods such as Live Composite and Multiple Exposure without having to access the menu structure.
Bleach Bypass is a new option in Art Filter (ART) mode, which expands the range of photographic expressions by reproducing the silver retention method used when developing film.

All of these shooting modes are assigned to the revised, intuitive mode dial for easy access.

With 121 AF points covering most of the image area you can focus anywhere on the screen. The Continuous AF has a tracking ability to detect the subject movement, and photographers will find the Face Priority AF and Eye Detection AF really useful to ensure proper exposure and sharp focus automatically when shooting portraits.

Amazing OM-D Image Quality
Experience the exceptional resolution and astounding detail captured by the OLYMPUS Micro Four Thirds sensor and advanced image capture technology that rival those of D-SLR cameras. Together with its highly powerful image stabiliser, this technology brings out the very best in each M.ZUIKO lens.


5-axis Image Stabilisation (IS)
5-axis Image Stabilisation eliminates the blur caused by camera-shake in virtually any shooting situation â from shift movements with macros to angular shake with telephoto lenses, or rolling at night. 5-axis IS works irrespective of the lens attached and compensates admirably for up to four steps of shutter speed. Even movies recorded one-handed come out blur-free.


Electronic Viewfinder
Even easier image composition: the OLED Electronic Viewfinder boasts an amazing 2.36M dots for ultra-clear image composition of the whole subject plus real-time monitoring of all setting adjustments â all the control and detail you need to get the most out of your photography.


4K Time Lapse
Use the Time Lapse mode to create a series of images over time which can then be recompiled into a 4K movie where time appears to have been sped up. Create amazing movies with brilliant details.


Slow Motion
Boasting multi frame rate movie-making that matches any standard, the E-M10 Mark II gives you super smooth slow-motion playback (4x) â rich in detail for graphic capture of fast-moving subjects.


AF Targeting Pad
For intuitive focussing control while looking through the viewfinder, you can change the auto focus target to suit your subject by simply using your finger on the touch screen on the rear of the camera. Touch the screen and move the AF point to where you want it and still follow the action through the viewfinder at the same time.


Focus Bracketing
In this mode the E-M10 Mark II shoots a number of photos, each with different focus settings. Especially useful for close-ups and better macro shooting.


Silent Shutter mode
Now you can be in the centre of the action without being the centre of attraction. Silent Shutter mode makes sure the shutter release doesnât make a sound when pressed â for perfectly silent shooting.


Live Composite Mode
Shoot beautiful night-time and low-light compositions with the Live Composite mode. Here you can actually see the image build up on the screen as the picture is taken â giving you full freedom of how to expose for low-light static shots

The Nikon D850 is a 45.7 megapixel DSLR that gives full-frame photographers the ultimate combination of resolution, speed, and light sensitivity. An upgrade from the highly successful Nikon D810, The D850 is the first Nikon FX-format D-SLR camera to offer full-frame 4K UHD video, whilst time-lapse shooters can create high-resolution sequences under extremely low light with up to ISO 25600.





Nikon FX-format, backside illumination CMOS
sensor delivering 45.7 megapixels with ISO 64-25600
The D850 allows landscape photographers to capture a diverse range of scenes in sumptuously rich detail. It is the first Nikon D-SLR to use a backside illumination sensor, which allows incoming light to reach
photodiodes more efficiently. Together with the cameraâs low-noise performance, this enables it to achieve ISO 25600 despite its high pixel count. Whatâs more, it strikes an optimal balance between sensor sensitivity and the volume of light information accumulated in
photodiodes, yielding images with a wide dynamic range even at ISO 64 (expandable to ISO 32 equivalent) â the lowest native ISO setting offered by any camera manufacturer. Copper wiring is used to cut
electrical resistance, while the backside illumination structure allows a flexible wiring layout, reducing stray capacity. These measures enable 45-megapixel FX-format images to be captured at continuous
shooting speeds of 9 fps*1. And because the sensor is designed without an optical low-pass filter, it can harness the sharpness of 45 megapixels when combined with the high resolving power of NIKKOR lenses. The D850 yields pictures that can be enlarged as massive prints at up to A2 size or used for 8K digital signage displays.


EXPEED 5 powerful image processing
Thanks to its EXPEED 5 image-processing engine, EXPEED 5 processor renders delicate tonality in highly vivid colors, and its superb noise reduction suppresses noise effectively while maintaining detail. Its powerful calculation ability also permits high-speed continuous shooting at approx. 9 fps* with 45 megapixels, as well as full-frame, 4K UHD movie recording.


Picture Control system
Nikonâs Picture Control system helps you craft images that match your creative intentions and purposes. The D850 incorporates
the new Auto Picture Control, in addition to the seven existing presets. Each preset allows you to tune settings such as
sharpening and clarity, opening up a wider range of options for achieving your ideal image. You can adjust settings and store
them as your own custom Picture Controls.


Auto Picture Control
Auto Picture Control produces more desirable images by automatically fine-tuning the tone curve, color, sharpening and clarity of the Standard
option, according to each sceneâs characteristics. As a result, blue skies and verdant greens are rendered more vibrantly for landscape shots.
The Advanced Scene Recognition System is now even better at identifying light sources, meaning red colors can be emphasized in sunsets and
sunrises.


Silent photography at 45 megapixels
When capturing a night sky blanketed with stars, you probably want to avoid even the tiniest image blur to maximize the advantage of 45 megapixels. The D850âs silent photography function in live view mode utilizes an electronic shutter instead of triggering any mirror or shutter
movement, meaning it doesnât cause any mechanical vibration. Photographers can capture every last detail in 45 megapixels â and in complete
silence. This mode can be used in approx. 6-fps continuous shooting, but can also shoot approx. 8.6-megapixel pictures in DX image area at
approx. 30 fps.


New natural light auto white balance option
The D850 employs a new ânatural light autoâ white balance mode, taking advantage of
the Advanced Scene Recognition Systemâs improved light source identification function.
This option delivers optimal white balance results under natural light â a valuable asset
for landscape shooters. It makes it possible to respond quickly to changes in the weather
conditions without switching to the direct sunlight or cloudy options. When shooting scenes
such as an autumnal landscape awash with red leaves or spectacular orange sunset, it also
enhances the warm colors, helping create even more impressive pictures.


Convenient shooting with ND filters â Low-light metering down to -3 EV
The D850 employs a 180K-pixel RGB sensor with superb low-light sensitivity, the same as the flagship D5, offering
metering down to -3 EV*2. This helps enormously when shooting low-light scenes. It is also invaluable when
capturing long-exposure shots with ND filters (such as seascapes or running water), as it allows you to rely fully
on the cameraâs AE and AF without needing to detach the filter. Furthermore, the Advanced Scene Recognition
System uses the RGB sensorâs increased pixel count to enhance the accuracy of various auto controls such as
auto white balance, i-TTL balanced fill-flash, auto-area AF, 3D-tracking and Active D-Lighting, making it easier for photographers to achieve their desired results.


0.75Ã optical viewfinder
The D850 provides a wide field of view for easier subject confirmation with a 0.75Ã
magnification* for its optical viewfinder â the highest ever offered by a Nikon FXformat
D-SLR. The viewfinder has been redesigned to employ an aspherical lens and a
new condenser lens with refined refraction, allowing for a slimmer body while keeping
a sufficiently long eye point. Its high-contrast viewfinder information display uses
organic EL display elements, making it easier to read even under bright sunlight.

153-point AF system
The D850âs powerful 153-point AF system â the same acclaimed technology used in the
flagship D5 â delivers over 130% of the D810âs frame coverage, with 99 cross sensors
offering powerful detection. Thanks to a Multi-CAM 20K autofocus sensor module,
developed to keep noise to an absolute minimum, the central point functions at -4 EV* and
other focus points at -3 EV*. Accurate AF is possible in challenging low-light or low-contrast
situations â a great asset for landscape photographers shooting in the hours when light is
scarce, such as at sunrise and sunset, and especially useful for capturing nighttime scenes.

The X-T20 is also equipped with an Auto mode selector lever for selecting the fully-automatic Advanced SR Auto mode where the camera chooses the optimum settings for a given scene


24.3 megapixel APS-C sized X-Trans CMOS III sensor and X-Processor Pro image processing engine
The X-T20 features the new ACROS Film Simulation mode, while the larger phase detection AF area and updated algorithm deliver an ultra-fast AF speed of 0.06sec. The X-T20 also offers 5.0fps live-view shooting, a quick start-up time of 0.4sec. shutter time lag of 0.050sec.and shooting interval of 0.25sec.


AF-C Custom Settings for moving subjects
The X-T20 features AF-C Custom Settings where you can choose from five AF-C presets according to the way your chosen subject is moving. The AF algorithm has been revised for improved accuracy, resulting in a dramatic improvement when tracking a moving subject in the AF-C mode.


High resolution and high definition 4K video recording
The X-T20 is capable of recording both Full HD and 4K video using the X Seriesâ famous Film Simulation effects. You can output recorded video to an external monitor via the HDMI port and input audio from an external microphone.


Intuitive operation with the touchscreen display
The LCD monitor uses a capacitive touchscreen panel to facilitate high-angle shots, taken from above a crowd of people or an obstacle, as well as low-angle shots simulating the perspective of small children or pets. 


Improved AF performance for the moving subjects
The number of focusing points has been dramatically expanded from 49 in the previous model to 91 (up to 325 points).  Approx. 40% of the imaging area (the centre area containing 49 focusing points) is covered with phase detection AF pixels to form a fast and precise phase detection AF area that can be used in a variety of scenes.

425,jessops-7bf1e982556ed129f5482c5717d0369f,'Pentax K-1 Digital SLR Body','Digital SLRs',pound,1598.97,'Pentax',,True,"Pentax K-1 Digital SLR Body 
The Pentax K-1 is the flagship model of the acclaimed Pentax K series. Along with a weatherproof construction and 36.4 effective megapixels, this 35mm full-frame Digital SLR includes state-of-the-art high-resolution technologies drawn from Pentaxâs development of medium-format models, plus an array of exclusive shooting features.     




Full-frame CMOS image sensor
The K-1 incorporates a newly developed 35mm full-frame CMOS image sensor, one that assures the highest image quality to be found in the K-mount SLR series. Thanks to its large imaging area and wide pixel pitch, this high-pixel sensor delivers lively, true-to-life images with rich gradation and minimal noise. Its shallow depth of field allows you to control the sense of depth and bokeh (defocused) effect at will.


36.4 effective megapixels
Thanks to its approximately 36.4 effective megapixels, the K-1 delivers breathtaking, true-to-life imagesâthe kind that will seize the viewerâs imagination. Its exceptional resolving power captures each leaf of a distant tree or every drop of a spray in the finest detail. Since it provides image data large enough to produce a brilliant A2-size print (at 300dpi), the photographer is assured of great flexibility in image composition, either by cropping the image during shooting, or trimming the captured image during processing. By processing large volumes of data with its 14-bit image-processing system, the K-1 delivers beautiful, rich-gradation images.


AA-filter-free design
An optical AA (anti-aliasing) filter will affect the cameraâs image resolving power, even though it will help reduce moirÃ© and false color. The K-1 incorporates an AA-filter-free design to optimize the image resolving power of its high-pixel image sensor.


Prime IV Engine
The K-1 features a newly designed PRIME IV imaging engine. Compared with the previous PRIME III version, it is fine-tuned to process higher-resolution images, while boosting the operating frequency by nearly 50 percent. Its noise-processing algorithm has also been upgraded to capture beautiful, fine-gradation images at higher sensitivities. A combination of an advanced scene analysis system and new image-processing functions helps improve the accuracy and reliability of image reproduction.


ISO 204800
By taking full advantage of the image sensor excelled in noise-resistance performance and the PRIME IV imaging engine, the K-1 provides a top sensitivity of ISO 204800 (at standard output sensitivity). This not only delivers high-resolution images free of tone jumps and graininess at high-sensitivity settings, but also improves image quality in the low-sensitivity range. Since the K-1 allows you to raise the sensitivity level to capture images equal in image quality to those taken at lower sensitivities, it expands the boundaries of photographic expression.


Newly developed AF system, with an expanded AF detection area
The K-1âs AF frame has been widened to optimize the ease of image composition over a larger 35mm full-frame image field. Thanks to the development of a new SAFOX 12 AF sensor module, its autofocus area is approximately 40 percent wider than a conventional AF frame.* In order to contain a longer optical path required for the expanded AF area within a compact housing, the K-1 features an innovative, efficient optical design in which the incoming light is turned back within the AF module. Thanks to the optimization of the condenser lens, it also provides an increased number of AF sensor points (33 in total). This state-of-the-art AF module boosts both compact dimensions and exceptional image-forming performance.


33-point AF system with 25 cross-shaped sensors
The K-1âs sophisticated 33-point AF system has a high-density distribution of AF sensors to effectively monitor crucial areas of the image field, while providing 25 cross-shaped sensors to assure extra-accurate focus on the subject.


1/8000-second high-speed shutter
The K-1 features an electronically controlled, vertical-run shutter to optimize the performance of the 35mm full-frame image sensor. With a top speed of 1/8000 second, it allows you to open up the aperture, even in bright locations, and take full advantage of the bokeh (defocus) effect created by the large image sensor. It also provides a flash synchronization speed of 1/200 second. Symbolizing the K-1âs field camera concept, this unit is designed to be compact and lightweight, with a well-balanced combination of high-precision operation and outstanding durability.


High-speed drive mode
The K-1 provides high-speed continuous shooting at a top speed of approximately 4.4 images per second (at CH setting). You can also switch instantly to an optional speed setting of three images per second (CM) or 0.7 images per second (CL) using the main menu or Smart Function. In the APS-C Crop mode, the drive speed can be boosted to as high as approximately 6.5 images per second to assure quick response to fast-moving subjects.


Pixel Shift Resolution System
Reinforced with the SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism, the K-1âs Pixel Shift Resolution System captures four images of the same scene by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for each image, then synthesizes them into a single, super-high-resolution composite image. Compared to the conventional Bayer system, this innovative system obtains all RGB colour data in each pixel to deliver beautiful images with far more truthful colours and much finer details, without any hint of false colour. This system also reduces high-sensitivity noise to a minimum. The difference in image quality is evident at a glance, even without magnifying the captured image on a computer screen or producing a large-size print. Images captured by the Pixel Shift Resolution System can be saved as RAW-format files. You can developed these files within the camera body while adjusting various parameters or turning the Pixel Shift Resolution effect on and off to create a new image.


Motion Correction function
When shooting an image with the Pixel Shift Resolution System, the K-1 provides a new Motion Correction function. When this function is activated, the camera automatically detects the amount of subject motion during continuous shooting and minimizes negative effects during the synthesizing process.


AA filter simulator
By using the cameraâs SR mechanism to apply microscopic vibrations to the image sensor, the PENTAX-original AA (anti-aliasing) filter simulator effectively minimizes moirÃ© and false color along the imageâs edges, which are common problems when shooting subjects with minute patterns. The K-1 allows you to faithfully reproduce your creative intention on a captured image, either by simulating the AA-filter effect for well-balanced images or by opting for the AA-filter-free mode for greater resolving power.


Diffraction Correction
This function compensates for the drop in resolving power caused by the diffraction during image processing. Based on obtained image data, it provides an exposure compensation of up to approximately two aperture steps, making it useful for such subjects as landscapes, which requires you to close down the aperture to widen a depth of field without compromising the resolving power.


Fine Sharpness and Extra Sharpness
No matter how many pixels and how much resolving power an image sensor may provide, the captured image can appear as a low-resolution image if the subject is outlined with thick lines. The K-1âs Fine Sharpness function outlines the subject with thinner, more natural lines than those created by normal processing to produce a high-quality, fine-detailed image. It allows you to create a fine piece of art, with a true-to-life description of the subject. The K-1 also provides an Extra Sharpness function, which emphasizes the subjectâs outline more prominently with much finer lines, making it particularly useful for enhancing the outline of a low-contrast subject.


In-body shake reduction mechanism
The PENTAX-original sensor-shift-type shake reduction mechanism has been upgraded to provide optimum compensation for all lenses used in handheld shooting. The new-generation SR II (Shake Reduction II) features a five-axis mechanism to compensate for camera shake caused by horizontal and vertical shift. The SR II unit is controlled with great precision as soon as the cameraâs power is turned on, and provides a wide compensation range â as much as five shutter steps.


Dustproof, weather-resistant construction
A combination of the K-1âs 87 sealing parts and the optional D-BG6 Battery Gripâs watertight body prevents the intrusion of water and dust into their interior. When an AW- or WR-series lens is mounted, the K-1 and its lens forms a remarkable digital imaging system totally resistant to demanding environmental factors. The camera is also -10Â°C cold-resistant. 


Flexible Tilt-Type LCD monitor
PENTAX has designed an ideal LCD monitor for the K-1 by creating an innovative mechanism that supports the monitor with four stays. This monitor has reached two difficult goals that conventional monitors have failed to attain: no deviation from the optical axis; and unrestricted tilt in all directions, horizontally or vertically. You can even tilt it up to a nearly 90-degree angle for low-angle and waist-level photography.


Outdoor-oriented LCD monitor
With a single push of a button, the K-1âs new Outdoor View Setting mode displays five brightness settings on its LCD monitor, allowing you to easily and quickly set the desired brightness level for a given location â brightening the monitor under dazzling sunshine or darkening it under starlit skies.


Optical viewfinder with a nearly 100% field of view
The K-1âs optical viewfinder provides a nearly 100-percent field of view and a 0.7-times magnification to deliver a sharp, crisp view of the subject and a large, well-defined image field, both of which are the benefits of the 35mm full-frame SLR camera. This viewfinder also provides a clear view of the image field free of aberrations, even at the edges. Its Natural-Bright-Matte III focusing screen makes it easy to identify the in-focus point, even during manual-focus operation.


Built-in GPS module and Electronic Compass
The K-1 features a built-in GPS module and Electronic Compass, which together display the camera's direction on the LCD monitor. These features allow you to attach Exif data to recorded images, including the location, direction and time of shooting (using Universal Time Coordinated). 


Movie recording
The K-1 records lively, true-to-life movies. Thanks to a shallow depth of field provided by its 35mm full-frame design, it effectively produces a beautiful bokeh effect.


4K-compatible Interval Movie shooting
The K-1âs Interval Movie mode allows you to record still images of a slowly changing subject at a fixed interval, and link them into a single movie file. You can play back the 4K-resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) movie file, as if fast-forwarding the time on the screen. The K-1 also provides the Star Stream function, which lets you draw the magical traces of stars in a movie.


Wi-Fi compatibility
By wirelessly connecting the K-1 with your smartphone, you can capture images from a distance, or browse them on the smartphone screen. You can set various shooting functions and change their settings, adjust the focus, release the shutter, and check the captured images.


In-body RAW data development
The K-1 provides in-body development of RAW-format files, with the developed files saved as separate JPEG or TIFF files. This offers greater flexibility in finishing a captured image more faithfully to your creative intention, without the help of a PC. Thanks to a wide range of adjustable parameters, you can add a desired finishing touch to your image regardless of a location, until you are truly satisfied with the result. The K-1 also features a newly designed user interface for more effortless, more flexible parameter control.


Dual card slot
The K-1âs card slot accepts two SD memory cards, with a choice of three data filing modes: âSerialâ to store a large volume of data successively from one card to another; âDuplicateâ (simultaneous filing) for simplified data backup, and âRAW/JPEG Divisionâ to separate data files based on the recording format. It is also possible to copy an image stored on one card to another.
